This repository presents a machine learning-based solution to forecast organizational salary sheets accurately. By leveraging historical payroll data and predictive algorithms, this project aims to assist organizations in planning budgets, managing payroll efficiently, and gaining insights into salary trends. 
It demonstrates the practical application of machine learning techniques to real-world business challenges.
Predictive Modeling: Implements advanced machine learning algorithms to forecast salary trends.
Data Insights: Analyzes historical salary data to identify patterns and anomalies.
Customizable Framework: Designed to adapt to different organizational requirements and datasets.
Evaluation Metrics: Assesses model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Project Structure:
1).datasets/: Contains sample datasets used for training and testing.
2).notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step implementation of the project.
3).scripts/: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
4).results/: Includes visualizations and performance metrics of the forecasting models.
