The proposal of Bam Dev Gautam, who has formed CPN (Unity National Campaign), to rejoin CPN-UML has got stuck.
Gautam, who seems enthusiastic after the main opposition party removed the age limit of 70 years for executive committees, had reached UML office Chyasal and met Chairman KP Sharma Oli on June 18 and expressed his wish to rejoin the party.
Gautam, who has claimed that he can help UML expand its party membership to six million, had also briefed Oli about his preliminary concept of achieving socialism with Nepali characteristics during the meeting.
But UML seems lukewarm to his proposal. “I had gone with the proposal of unification. I had cordial and open talks with Oli. He had said that we should unite, and invited me,” Gautam told Setopati. “But they have not got back to me now. They have not even called me.”
He stated that he had told Oli that he would return with party cadres and asked what role he would be given. “But he did not give solid answers. He only said I should join the party. He said that he alone could not give responsibilities and party committees should take decision. We have not had additional discussion after that.”
There were also talks about him joining the Socialist Front announced by CPN (Maoist Center), CPN (Unified Socialist), Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP) and CPN led by Netra Bikram Chand. “Nobody has come to me to talk about Socialist Front.”
Prime Minister (PM) Pushpa Kamal Dahal has been talking about reviving CPN formed after unification of Maoist Center and UML.
Gautam has also been working toward that. “I am always for unification. I have no doubts that the socialist movement would not succeed until communist parties unite. Not just UML but all including Maoist Center and Unified Socialist should, therefore, unite. These three parties should first unify and other parties should be brought along. That is my aim. I would work on that as long as I’m alive.”
UML Vice-chairman Bishnu Paudel confirmed with Setopati that Gautam’s proposal had not moved forward.
Gautam, who is currently National Assembly member having won the election on the ticket of the then CPN after losing from Bardiya in the general election of 2017 on a UML ticket, had quit UML on September 3, 2021 accusing Oli of defying constitutional supremacy and the rule of law in his resignation letter and slammed him for twice dissolving the House with utter disregard to the people's mandate.
He had also split UML in 1997 to form CPN-ML and returned back to the party four years later. He was accused of returning back to UML losing a big chunk of the party’s cadres to the Maoists who were waging an armed insurgency then.
Gautam, who was elected UML vice-chairman in the eighth and the ninth general conventions, still harbors hopes for the post of chairman.  
Many UML leaders are against him rejoining the party citing his unstable and opportunist nature, and high ambitions.
“Gautam laid groundwork for split of UML. Why bring him in UML? What can Gautam, who spent his age and energy to weaken the UML movement, do joining the party in the late stage of his life?” a UML leader fumed.

The Election Commission has prepared bill about election management in a way that the election date would be specified by the law.
It has prepared the draft of the bill in a way that a new umbrella law is formulated to replace all the existing laws related to election.
The draft bill has proposed to hold the election for president and vice-president three days before expiry of their five-year term.
Election for the House of Representatives (HoR) and provincial assemblies will be held on the first Sunday after four years and 11 months of announcement of the result of last election.
It has, however, proposed that the date for HoR election would be as per the one fixed by president if the HoR were dissolved. Provincial chief, similarly, would fix the date for election of provincial assembly if that were dissolved.
The local election will also be held on the first Sunday after four years and 11 months of announcement of the last election result.
The Election Commission has also proposed to hold election for National Assembly on the first Sunday one month before end of the term as in the case of HoR.
The Election Commission seems to have proposed Sunday as the election day considering that Saturday is public holiday in Nepal.
The Election Commission has proposed that it can set election date in consultation with the Government of Nepal if election could not be held on the stipulated date due to disasters.
Chief Election Commissioner Dinesh Thapaliya told Setopati that the Election Commission would soon submit the draft bill to the Home Ministry and the Federal Parliament.
“We have also talked with the Law Ministry and the Home Ministry. This draft has been prepared as per international practices about election,” Thapaliya said. “What kind of law will be formulated would depend on how much the political parties accept in the House.”

The ruling coalition has decided to field Uddhav Thapa of Nepali Congress (NC) as the candidate for chief minister (CM) of Koshi.
“We have advised to bring forward provincial parliamentary party leader of Congress Uddhav Thapa on behalf of the coalition for CM of Koshi,” Acting Chairman of CPN (Unified Socialist) Rajendra Pandey said after the meeting of top coalition leaders at Baluwatar on Monday.
The CPN-UML led government fell on June 30 after Hikmat Karki failed floor test by one vote.

Karki could secure only 46 votes in the provincial assembly that has 93 lawmakers during the floor test. Forty-three lawmakers voted against CM Karki in the floor test with the only Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP) lawmaker Nirmala Limbu abstaining from voting.
Forty UML lawmakers and six lawmakers from coalition partner RPP voted in support of the Karki government. NC, CPN (Maoist Center) and Unified Socialist voted against the government.

Minister for Agriculture and Livestock Development Beduram Bhusal has appointed the 40th-ranked Dhruba Raj Bhattarai as the acting executive director of Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC).
Bhusal has given NARC’s leadership to Bhattarai exercising his authority as the ex officio chairman of NARC.
As Bhattarai and Bhusal are both from Arghakhanchi and enjoy close relations, Bhusal has appointed Bhattarai leaving out senior directors.
Deepak Bhandari, the then executive director of NARC, went on a compulsory retirement on June 11. Bhandari had made the second-ranked Dr Dojraj Ghimire acting executive director when he retired.
Bhusal has replaced Ghimire with Bhattarai, who ranks far below.
As per the NARC regulation, a search committee first recommends the names of three candidates when appointing a new executive director. The Cabinet then appoints one of them as the executive director of NARC.
“But Minister Bhusal made a mockery of NARC’s tradition by forcibly appointing a 40th-ranked person as the acting executive director,” Dr Ram Prasad Ghimire, president of the Society of Agricultural Scientists Nepal, told Setopati. “This has vitiated the environment for scientists to join NARC.”
Bhusal appointed Bhattarai as NARC’s acting executive director on June 16. Taking exception to the appointment, NARC scientists had then gone to meet Bhusal to draw his attention to the issue.
“We had gone to draw [Bhusal’s] attention on June 19 after he brought a junior person to NARC’s leadership on June 16,” Ghimire told Setopati. “But he answered that he was a minister and exercised his authority.”
Issuing a statement, the Society of Agricultural Scientists Nepal has urged Bhusal to rectify the mistake.
But Bhusal said that Bhattarai has been made acting executive director only until the next executive director is appointed.
He claimed that people affiliated with various political parties spread unnecessary rumors on the issue after things didn’t go their way.
“The regulation has a provision that one of the directors can be made the acting executive director. The one I appointed is also a director,” Bhusal said. “This arrangement has been made only until a new executive director is appointed. After the search committee recommends three people later, the Cabinet will appoint the executive director from among them.”
It has emerged that Bhusal had made Bhattarai director only two weeks earlier for the sole purpose of appointing him as the acting executive director.
While Bhusal has already appointed Bhattarai as the acting executive director, he has yet to start the process for appointment of a new executive director.
Generally, the agriculture minister has to start the process for appointing a new executive director of NARC by forming a search committee before the post falls vacant. The search committee is headed by the Agriculture Ministry’s secretary.
“But the minister did not even form a search committee this time. And he made a person he favors the acting executive director,” Ghimire said. “Even now he hasn’t formed a search committee and started the appointment process for a new executive director.”
Bhusal said that he has not been able to start the process for appointment of NARC’s executive director as he had been busy with the budget and other issues.
He said that a new executive director will be appointed soon by forming a search committee.

The Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) has given a 24-hour ultimatum for removal of the temporary structures within erstwhile Lalita Niwas.
“A team of KMC Police went there today. A 24-hour ultimatum has been issued to remove all temporary structures there,” Surendra Bajgai, Press Facilitator of KMC Mayor Balen Shah, told Setopati.
A team led by KMC Police Chief Raju Pandey earlier reached Baluwatar to put wire fencing around the plots that have been encroached as part of the Baluwatar land grab.
The team is currently putting wire fencing around the land.
The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police on Tuesday arrested seven persons including promoter of Bhatbhateni Min Bahadur Gurung and former election commissioner Sudheer Kumar Shah in connection with the Baluwatar land grab.
Along with Gurung and Shah, Kaladhar Deuja, the then chief of the Land Revenue Office, Dilli Bazaar, and LRO employees Dharma Prasad Gautam, Surendra Man Kapali, Gopal Karki, and Hupendra Mani KC were also arrested on Tuesday.
Shah served as election commissioner from February 16, 2017, to April 11, 2019.
Police said that the CIB had been investigating the case and arrested the seven after collecting further evidence against them.
The CIB had submitted its report to the District Government Attorney’s Office (DGAO), Kathmandu, in December 2021 after completing its investigation into the case. But the DGAO had returned the report instructing the CIB to carry out further investigation.
The government had formed a probe committee under former secretary Sharada Prasad Trital following complaints that government land at Baluwatar has been transferred to some individuals. The committee had submitted the report to the government in December 2018 concluding that the land transferred to individuals belonged to the government.
The committee stated that the then king Mahendra after the coup in 1951 had confiscated 14 ropanis land of Nepali Congress leader Suvarna Shumsher Rana and his son Kanchan Shumsher in Baluwatar.
The government four years later acquired 285 ropanis of Rana's land in Baluwatar by paying compensation. The prime minister's residence, chief justice's residence, speaker's residence and the central office of Nepal Rastra Bank are currently situated in 172 ropanis out of the 285 ropanis.
Land mafia in connivance with staffers at the Land Revenue Office has transferred ownership of the remaining 113 ropanis of land to different individuals, the committee has concluded.
CPN-UML leader and former finance minister Bishnu Paudel was also dragged into the controversy as eight annas out of the 113 ropanis has been transferred in the name of his son Navin.
But Paudel and Supreme Court (SC) Justice Kumar Regmi have not been charged in the scam after they agreed to return the land in the name of Paudel's son Navin and Regmi respectively.
""It does not seem necessary to make them defendants as they have agreed to return the land plots inside Lalita Niwas to the Nepal Government in their statement to the investigation officer and the application filed with the CIAA,"" the CIAA charge sheet stated.
Regmi has claimed that he received the land for handling a case while working as advocate while Paudel has claimed that he bought the land.

Nepali Congress (NC) General Secretary Gagan Thapa is planning a nationwide campaign to listen to the common people and party cadres.
He will remain outside the Kathmandu Valley for 33 consecutive days starting in September, and start the second stage of his campaign after the Tihar festival.
Thapa will not deliver any public speech throughout the campaign and listen to the people at the grassroots. “We put our opinion while going outside Kathmandu now and don’t get to talk with the people,” Thapa has told Setopati. “Those of us who go from Kathmandu give speech from the dais as if we know everything, and then return. We don’t even know about the people’s problems as we don’t talk with them. I feel we miss many things due to this attitude.”
Thapa has said that he will mainly look for answers to questions related to why the party leaders and cadres are rattled and disappointed, and why the general public are also similarly disappointed and angry.
“Congress became the largest party at the center, and provincial and local levels. There should have been a festive and celebratory mood in the leaders and cadres. But that is not so,” he has pointed. “There is rage inside and outside the party. Why is that happening? I want to gather knowledge after talking with people. I am going for public dialogue campaign for that.”
He has planned to visit places in 35 districts of the mountains, hills and Madhes plains in the first stage. He will visit the other districts after Tihar.  
He will not give any public speech during the campaign and no party committee will organize formal programs during his campaign. “There was hope in the people that tomorrow would be better at the time of armed conflict, king’s direct rule, earthquake, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Why is that hope disappearing now? I will look for answers to such questions,” he has revealed. “I want to meet people who are not associated with the party structures and try to understand how they are looking at me. Where did Congress err? Why are the people angry? Why is hope disappearing?”
He has added that he will talk with people of all age groups and return to Kathmandu only after finding answers to such questions. “I will have some grounds for debate when I return after talking with the people. I will discuss about that inside the party. I will start the public dialogue campaign after holding discussion even with my colleagues.”

Another writ petition had also been filed at the SC over Lamichhane’s citizenship controversy last year.
After the final hearing on the petition on January 27, the SC had ruled that Lamichhane was ineligible to become a lawmaker as he did not complete the process to re-acquire his citizenship certificate that became invalid after he acquired US citizenship. Lamichhane had resigned as deputy prime minister and home minister the same day.

Prime Minister (PM) Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that efforts are being made to erase the memoray of improvement in living standard of the people in the past 20 years.
“A new generation of voters has been ready in the country that did not have to suffer the cruelties of war, walk to the school and see the royal regime that shut down the internet and the telephone communication, and obstructed the airports and the streets,” Dahal has stated addressing the House of Representatives (HoR) meeting on Wednesday.
“The unrestrained generation n the social media also does not know about the history that the men in uniform entered the media houses and instructed the editors what to print and what to show. We don’t have any right to mislead that generation building a narrative as if there were rivers of milk in the past.”
He has also expressed concern that the people’s agendas are getting lost amidst cheap issues and asked whether that spreads disenchantment among the people. “Are our political character and face not getting weak due to our own behavior?”   
He has also listed achievements of his government claiming that textbooks for students of community schools were distributed across the country at the start of new academic session this year, and students no longer have to wait overnight in serpentine queues to get no objection certificates (NOC) to go abroad for further study pointing that NOC can now be obtained over the phone.

Nepali Congress (NC) General Secretary Gagan Thapa has proposed to bar professors, teachers and students from NC membership.
Pointing that politicization has ravaged the education sector he has called for debate inside the party to ban professors, teachers and students from NC membership. He has stressed that situation was different when he was in student politics with the restrictions imposed by autocratic monarchy and the threat of Maoist insurgency, and the time demanded politics of resistance. He has added that students and teachers no longer need to join politics.
“Why make chairman of school management committee, campus chief and vice-chancellor Congress?” Thapa has asked while addressing a program in his constituency of Kathmandu-4. “The education sector has been ravaged after we also competed to make Congress when UML made organizations in different names. People are angry due to that.”
Thapa’s proposal, however, has not entered for formal discussion in the grand old party that has not convened central committee meeting in 11 months. “Why not debate about this in the party? Good professors can join politics after resignation if they so wish. We would then ask them to contest for ward chairman from our ward or mayor.”
He has also slammed the party’s student wing Nepal Student Union for thrashing and misbehaving with teachers and professors. “Can I smear soot on someone’s body merely because the person did not do what I said? Can I attack any person be it professor or others for not obeying my instruction or I don’t like the person?” he fumed. “There should not be any ifs and buts on this issue of smearing soot and thrashing professors. That is wrong.”

The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police has initiated investigations on organized crime in the Baluwatar land grab case.
The CIB, that was earlier investigating the accused persons for forgery, has now started investigations for organized crime with permission of the Kathmandu District Court.  
The CIB, that has arrested nine persons in connection to the case until now, sought extension of their custody through the District Government Attorney Office, Kathmandu on Tuesday. The Kathmandu District Court had granted custody for seven days for investigations on forgery when the accused were presented to the court on June 28.
The court granted extension of seven days on Tuesday for investigations on organized crime.
The quantum of punishment is higher in case of organized crime than forgery and the police can also get a longer custody for investigations on organized crime.
Accused persons can be kept in custody for up to 60 days for investigations on organized crime while those investigated for forgery can be kept for only up to 25 days, according to Chief of the District Government Attorney Office, Kathmandu Achyut Mani Neupane.
The government had formed a probe committee under former secretary Sharada Prasad Trital following complaints that government land at Baluwatar has been transferred to some individuals.

The committee stated that the then king Mahendra after the coup in 1951 had confiscated 14 ropanis land of Nepali Congress leader Suvarna Shumsher Rana and his son Kanchan Shumsher in Baluwatar.
The government four years later acquired 285 ropanis of Rana's land in Baluwatar by paying compensation. The prime minister's residence, chief justice's residence, speaker's residence and the central office of Nepal Rastra Bank are currently situated in 172 ropanis out of the 285 ropanis.
Land mafia in connivance with staffers at the Land Revenue Office has transferred ownership of the remaining 113 ropanis of land to different individuals, the committee has concluded.

But Paudel and Supreme Court (SC) Justice Kumar Regmi have not been charged in the scam after they agreed to return the land in the name of Paudel's son Navin and Regmi respectively.
""It does not seem necessary to make them defendants as they have agreed to return the land plots inside Lalita Niwas camp to the Nepal Government in their statement to the investigation officer and the application filed with the CIAA,"" the CIAA charge sheet stated.

The chief priest of Bhairavsthan Temple in Palpa has been found to have inflicted sexual violence on girls and women.
Chief priest Jeet Nath Yogi of the temple at Ribdikot Rural Municipality 4 has been found to be touching chest of women and girls in the pretext of offering tika, and giving prasad (edibles offered to deity during worship).
Devotees are allowed to worship the deities outside the main temple themselves but not the Bharaiv Baba inside the main temple. They have to offer the prasad and flowers through the priests. Yogi, 70, has been found to be touching the women at the narrow place where they hand over their offerings and get them back.
Setopati has acquired a video showing Yogi clearly touching chest of the female devotees deliberately.
“The hands touched my breasts when the priest gave the basket (of prasad) to me. I first presumed he may have touched inadvertently,” a girl told Setopati. “I then stayed there and looked at him put tika on my sisters and friends. He did the same to them. He touched their breasts stretching his hands.”
The 21-year-old girl who went to the temple from Rupandehi told Setopati that she talked with other female devotees about the issue after that and all of them confirmed that Yogi touched their chest. The women and girls then made video recording of the chief priest touching the girls and women.
The girl did not tell anyone in the family about the incident after returning from the temple. When her maternal aunt went to the temple two weeks later Yogi touched the aunt similarly.  
They had gone in a group of nine and claimed that Yogi touched all five who offered prasad. They then complained with the temple management committee.
Head of the management committee Min Bahadur Budhathoki told Setopati that he directed the closed-circuit television camera installed in the temple toward the chief priest without knowledge of Yogi after hearing about the complaint from the girls and women. “Chief priest Yogi was seen to be returning the basket touching and pushing women’s chest in the video. Priest of such a big place of devotion apparently was inflicting violence on women. The temple management committee will punish him,” Budhathoki stated.
Chief District Officer of Palpa Bandhu Prasad Bastola told Setopati that no formal complaint against Yogi had been received, and added that Yogi would be arrested even if just a single person were to complain.
Yogi had gone from Dang to become priest at the temple in 2002.
The temple was built by the then Sen king Mani Mukunda Sen in 1565 BS. The then army chief Khadga Shumsher then installed a brass trishul at the temple. The trishul is believed to be the biggest in Asia.

Three of the seven people who were arrested Tuesday morning in connection with the Baluwatar land grab case have been released after it emerged that they had obtained stay orders from the Supreme Court against their arrest.
According to Nawaraj Adhikari, spokesperson for the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police, Kaladhar Deuja, the then chief of the Land Revenue Office, Dilli Bazaar, and LRO employees Surendra Man Kapali and Hupendra Mani KC had obtained stay orders.
Adhikari said that the three have been released as per the stay order.
The CIB had arrested seven people including Deuja, Kapali and KC in connection with the Baluwatar land grab case on Tuesday morning. Those arrested also included promoter of Bhatbhateni supermarket Min Bahadur Gurung, former election commissioner Sudheer Kumar Shah, and LRO employees Dharma Prasad Gautam and Gopal Karki.
Gurung was one of those accused in the Baluwatar land grab, while Shah served as election commissioner from February 16, 2017, to April 11, 2019.
Police said that the CIB had been investigating the case and arrested the seven after collecting further evidence against them.
The CIB had submitted its report to the District Government Attorney’s Office (DGAO), Kathmandu, in December 2021 after completing its investigation into the case. But the DGAO had returned the report instructing the CIB to carry out further investigation.
The government had formed a probe committee under former secretary Sharada Prasad Trital following complaints that government land at Baluwatar has been transferred to some individuals. The committee had submitted the report to the government in December 2018 concluding that the land transferred to individuals belonged to the government.
The committee stated that the then king Mahendra after the coup in 1951 had confiscated 14 ropanis land of Nepali Congress leader Suvarna Shumsher Rana and his son Kanchan Shumsher in Baluwatar.
The government four years later acquired 285 ropanis of Rana's land in Baluwatar by paying compensation. The prime minister's residence, chief justice's residence, speaker's residence and the central office of Nepal Rastra Bank are currently situated in 172 ropanis out of the 285 ropanis.
Land mafia in connivance with staffers at the Land Revenue Office has transferred ownership of the remaining 113 ropanis of land to different individuals, the committee has concluded.
CPN-UML leader and former finance minister Bishnu Paudel was also dragged into the controversy as eight annas out of the 113 ropanis has been transferred in the name of his son Navin.
But Paudel and Supreme Court (SC) Justice Kumar Regmi have not been charged in the scam after they agreed to return the land in the name of Paudel's son Navin and Regmi respectively.
""It does not seem necessary to make them defendants as they have agreed to return the land plots inside Lalita Niwas camp to the Nepal Government in their statement to the investigation officer and the application filed with the CIAA,"" the CIAA charge sheet stated.
Regmi has claimed that he received the land for handling a case while working as advocate while Paudel has claimed that he bought the land.

                            The government has stepped back from the decision to host the International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) Awards in Kathmandu.
Deepak Raj Joshi, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Nepal Tourism Board (NTB) that has been handed responsibility to coordinate the hosting of event, told Setopati that it has decided to immediately stop all preparations.
The International Relations Committee of the parliament has already instructed the government to not host the event. CEO Joshi said preparations will be stopped due to that instruction and in respect of public sentiments. ""We had taken the event as an opportunity for tourism promotion and branding. But we have decided to stop it feeling it is not the appropriate time to host the event due to the instruction of parliamentary committee and other political and social reasons,"" he added.
Minister for Communication and Information Technology Gokul Baskota during the weekly press conference on Thursday had said the event will be hosted in a way that the NTB and the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) are joint co-organizers. The event was scheduled for the last week of August.
The government had formed a high level committee under Minister of State for Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation Dhan Bahadur Buda.
The event would have cost the government almost Rs 1 billion. The organizers had demanded US$ 4 million from Nepal for getting to organize the event while Nepal would also have to provide air fares, accommodation and local transportation for the guests and participants, the majority of whom demanded business class tickets and five-star accommodation.
The government's decision was widely criticized after revelation that the event will be hosted with taxpayers' money.

                            The government will have to spend almost Rs 1 billion to organize the International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) Awards.
The organizers have demanded US$ 4 million from Nepal for getting to organize the event, according to Nepal Tourism Board (NTB) CEO Deepak Raj Joshi.
The Cabinet has decided to organize the event in Nepal with NTB and Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) the joint co-organizers.
Coordinator of the Visit Nepal Year Suraj Vaidya and Joshi have been handed the responsibility to negotiate with the organizers about the event fee. ""We are in course of discussion. We have only held discussions on the venue and guests but have yet to sign agreement. We have yet to finalize event fee as well,"" Joshi told Setopati.
Joshi revealed that the organizers have demanded the amount for technical preparations including event management to fees for the artistes. But both the NTB and KMC do not have working procedure to pay a foreign company in such manner.
A member of the high-level committee formed by the government to organize the event confided that additional Rs 200 million will be needed for air fares, accommodation and local transportation for the guests and participants. ""The majority of them have demanded business class tickets while they will also want five-star hotels. Another Rs 200 million will have to be spent in that,"" the member told Setopati.
Millions will also have to be spent on security for the guests and awards taking the expenditure to almost Rs 1 billion.
NTB CEO Joshi, however, claimed that the money will be well-spent providing unprecedented promotion for Nepal. ""This is an event with a viewership greater than that of Oscars. This will create a brand for the city. We can also send a message that we are capable and safe to organize such huge events,"" he reasoned. ""They will name the event Nepal IIFA and many television channels will promote the event as Nepal IIFA.""
He said the event will also provide an opportunity to bring multiple stars. ""We have to spend around Rs 50 million to bring one star now. Around 100 stars of that level will arrive for the event. Videos about Nepali destinations will also be played during the event. We have almost agreed on that. Such videos will be useful for us even in the future.""

                            Actor Arnold Schwarzenegger was assaulted during a public appearance in South Africa on Saturday, but the 71-year-old quickly recovered and said, “I’m just glad the idiot didn’t interrupt my Snapchat.”

Video shows the former California governor standing and filming children at a sporting event in Johannesburg when a man makes a flying kick into his back. Schwarzenegger stumbles forward. The man is quickly grabbed by security. Off camera a man shouts several times “Help me!”

The video shortly afterward shows Schwarzenegger smiling and shaking hands with bystanders before walking out ringed by security.

Schwarzenegger later posted on Twitter: “Thanks for your concerns, but there is nothing to worry about. I thought I was just jostled by the crowd, which happens a lot. I only realized I was kicked when I saw the video like all of you. I’m just glad the idiot didn’t interrupt my Snapchat.”

Schwarzenegger also tweeted a second video of the incident “without whatever he was yelling so he doesn’t get the spotlight.”

“By the way...” he joked, “block or charge?”

Schwarzenegger had been attending his Arnold Classic Africa event, which features dozens of sports and fitness activities. In a separate Twitter post, the event blamed a “crazed fan” for the assault.

The statement cited organizer Wayne Price as saying the assailant was “known to the police for orchestrating similar incidents in the past” and that Schwarzenegger was “fine and still in good spirits.”

The actor confirmed he had no intention of pursuing charges and would continue with another appearance on Sunday as planned, the statement said.

                            Mother’s Day is in a couple weeks, but Drake gave his mom an early gift with a heartfelt speech at the 2019 Billboard Music Awards, where the rap star also broke Taylor Swift’s record for most wins.

Drake turned up the love for his mom when he picked up top artist, besting Cardi B, Ariana Grande, Post Malone and Travis Scott. He won 12 awards Wednesday in Las Vegas, making his career total 27 (Swift has 23 wins).

He looked up to the ceiling as he held the trophy, then said: “I just want to thank my mom for her relentless effort in my life.

“I want to thank my mom for all the times you drove me to piano. All the times you drove me to basketball and hockey — that clearly didn’t work out. All the times you drove me to ‘Degrassi.’ No matter how long it took me to figure out what I wanted to do, you were always there to give me a ride, and now we’re on one hell of ride,” Drake said.

Family bonding was a theme at the three-hour show, which aired live on NBC and was hosted by Kelly Clarkson

Ciara’s young son and husband, NFL player Russell Wilson, danced along while she worked the stage, and Nick and Joe Jonas gave kisses to Priyanka Chopra and Sophie Turner of “Game of Thrones” fame when they sang in the audience before hitting the stage. Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco looked to his parents as he accepted top rock song, quoting the name of his current hit: “Hey look Ma, I made it!”

Mariah Carey’s twins cheered her on as she sang a medley of her hits and accepted the Icon award. She was in diva form before taking the award from Jennifer Hudson, throwing her napkin on the floor after dabbing her face with it.

“Without getting into all the drama, all the ups and downs of my career ... I guess I always felt like an outsider, someone who doesn’t quite belong anywhere, and I still feel like that lost interracial child who had a lot of nerve to believe I could succeed at anything at all in this world. But, and this is the truth, I did believe because I had to,” she said. “The truth is I dedicated my life to my music — my saving grace — and to my fans.”

Cardi B, the night’s top nominee with 21, locked lips with husband Offset on the red carpet and the couple sat closely inside the venue. She won six awards, including top Hot 100 song for “Girls Like You” with Maroon 5.

“I remember when Maroon 5 hit me up to do this song. I was like, ‘Bro I’m five months pregnant. I can’t even breathe.’ But this record to me was so amazing. I was like, ‘Oh this is going to be a hit.’ And now I sing this song to my daughter because she’s the girl that I need,” she said.

Drake and Cardi B — who both won multiple awards during the live telecast — used their speeches to promote love and appreciation for their peers in the music industry.

Others, too, brought on the positive energy when onstage. Imagine Dragons’ band leader Dan Reynolds used his speech to highlight the dangers of conversion therapy on LGBTQ youth. He earned rousing applause. Florida Georgia Line’s Tyler Hubbard followed suit, telling the audience after winning top country song: “In the spirit of so much truth being spoken tonight by so many talented artists, I think we should speak some truth.”

“As artists we all get to experience so many unbelievable things, but in our opinion, at the end of the day, it’s all for nothing if you’re not using your platform for better ... to spread love, to help those in needs, to be a light to your community,” he said.

Swift kicked off the show when she brought her new music video to life with a colorful, eye-popping performance of her song “ME!” Dancers wearing bright, pastel colors spun in the air holding umbrellas and a marching band kicked off Swift’s performance — like most of the world, maybe she was inspired by Beyonce’s new Coachella film?

Madonna, wearing an eye-patch, teamed up with Colombian singer Maluma for a performance, but it was Grammy-winning Christian artist Lauren Daigle who had the night’s best performance. She sang “You Say,” giving the audience a calm, yet strong and powerful performance. She was backed by three awesome background singers and a pianist.

BTS, who performed alongside Halsey, also had a major night. At the Billboard Awards and American Music Awards, the K-pop band had only previously won “social” awards based off their fanatic fan base, but on Wednesday BTS picked up top duo/group, besting Grammy-winning groups like Maroon 5, Imagine Dragons and Dan + Shay.

“I still can’t believe we’re here on this stage with so many great artists,” RM said as fans screamed loudly. “We’re still the same boys from six years ago, we still have the same dreams ... we still have the same thoughts. Let us keep dreaming.”

An unlikely winner at the Billboard Awards? “Game of Thrones” actress Maisie Williams, whose plays Arya Stark on the HBO series and shined brightly on last week’s episode.

“Shout-out to Arya Stark for putting in that work last week,” Drake said onstage after winning his first award of the evening.

Adele gave birth to their son, Angelo, in 2012.

The Grammy-winning British superstar has been private about her relationship, but confirmed she married Konecki when she won album of the year at the 2017 Grammys.

Los Angeles Superior Court documents show that Judge John W. Ouderkirk entered a judgment Friday, saying the couple is no longer married. Her name was also restored to just Jolie, not Jolie Pitt.

The couple’s lawyers had asked for a bifurcated judgment, meaning that two married people can be declared single before all issues in the divorce are agreed upon.

It’s not clear what issues remain unresolved in the divorce, but Jolie has filed papers saying Pitt wasn’t paying sufficient child support, which his attorneys disputed.

                            Actress Amber Heard asked a judge Thursday to dismiss a $50 million defamation lawsuit her ex-husband Johnny Depp filed over an op-ed about domestic violence she wrote in The Washington Post, and provided new evidence toward her allegations of abuse.

In the motion filed in the Circuit Court of Fairfax, Virginia, Heard describes in new detail more than a dozen instances before and during their marriage when she says Depp slapped her, shoved her, pulled her hair or choked her. Depp has denied any such abuse. The allegations have appeared in the couple’s divorce and other legal fights.

Heard includes exhibits such as photos of her with bruises on her face and scars on her arms, images of damage she says Depp did to their home, and newly revealed screenshots of text messages describing the incidents at the time, and excerpts of her divorce deposition describing domestic abuse.

“Johnny Depp physically and verbally abused Amber Heard,” her attorney Eric George said in a statement. “Since their divorce, Mr. Depp has continued to publically harass Ms. Heard, and attempted to gaslight the world by denying his abuse. It is long past time for Mr. Depp’s despicable conduct to end.”

Depp’s lawsuit, filed last month, called the ongoing allegations of domestic abuse “categorically and demonstrably false.”

“They were part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms. Heard and advance her career,” the lawsuit states, claiming that “she is the perpetrator.”

Depp’s attorney, Adam Waldman, said he was reviewing the new filing. He said previously that he and Depp looked forward to providing evidence that would clear Depp’s name.

The Post piece by Heard, published in December, does not mention Depp by name or describe any incidents, but it discusses the societal plight of those who speak up about domestic abuse.

“I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath,” the 32-year-old actress wrote, adding that she felt as though she was “on trial in the court of public opinion.”

But Depp’s lawsuit says it was clear Heard was talking about him, and that it worsened the damage the allegations had already done to his career.

The lawsuit states Depp, 55, has suffered financial losses because of the accusations, including being dropped from his role as Capt. Jack Sparrow in the “Pirates of the Caribbean” films.

Heard’s lawyers also argued that the lawsuit should be moved to Los Angeles because that’s where the relevant events took place and the court would be in a position to subpoena witnesses and find facts.

Heard first accused Depp of domestic violence in May 2016, the year after they were married. They were divorced in 2017.

The actress, whose credits include “Aquaman” and “Justice League,” met Depp on the set of their 2011 film “The Rum Diary.”

The wedding was attended by close friends and family members of the ""Shape of You"" hitmaker.

The couple had announced their engagement in December 2017.

""Got myself a fiancee just before new year. We are very happy and in love, and our cats are chuffed as well,"" Sheeran had shared on Instagram along side an adorable picture of him and Seaborn.

The couple were childhood friends who attended school together in Suffolk, but only became romantically involved years later.

                            Billy Porter, speaking to Vogue before he walked the Oscars red carpet, knew what he was in for among some social media users:

“People are going to be really uncomfortable with my black ass in a ball gown, but it’s not anybody’s business but mine.”

The remark from the Tony-winning stage performer, actor and singer was both prescient and disproven. There was mega-praise for his velvet custom tuxedo look by Christian Siriano and outrage over the notion that an African American man in a dress was a threat to black masculinity.

It was just the conversation Porter had hoped to provoke, not to collect virulent hate but to help move along the idea that we all deserve respect, across racial lines and the gender divide.

“I was ready to create the conversation,” Porter told The Associated Press in a phone interview Monday the day after the Oscars. “We have to teach people how to treat us, we have to teach people how to love us, we have to teach people how to respect us, and the only way we do that is to respect ourselves.”

Porter, the black and gay breakout star of the boundary-expanding FX series “Pose,” spent awards season using fashion as political art, as he describes it. There were previous dresses, and there was help from powerhouses Tom Ford and Michael Kors in the later weeks, along with smaller designers who embrace a greater gender fluidity in their collections and were thrilled early on to dress him.

As a nominee at the Golden Globes, Porter’s custom trouser look by Randi Rahm, including a huge, hot pink-lined cape and floral embellishments, grabbed attention, but social media support and disdain after the 49-year-old took to the Oscars carpet took the debate into the stratosphere.

Porter understands where established notions of black masculinity originated, and he understands how toxic they can be. He and his stylist, Sam Ratelle, also realize how rigid gender-driven taboos can be and want to help the walls come down.

“It goes all the way back to the earliest of emasculations, which is slavery, so the only way to sort of overcome that is to be the strongest and the most masculine and the most powerful and now, what has become toxic,” Porter said. “And I don’t think it’s just black people. I think it’s men in general. Every ethnicity has their version of it.”

Porter couldn’t care less about negative comments.

“The comments are not my business. What people think about what I’m doing is not my business. I lived that already,” he said. “I’m inside of my authenticity and the whole point is that you have to respect me as much as I respect you. If you don’t like it, go somewhere else. You don’t have to look. It’s not about you. I don’t understand why my putting on a dress causes this much strife in your life.”

Ratelle said he began working with Porter about a year ago.

“He said, ‘I want to be a piece of walking art,’ and we just went from there,” Ratelle said. “It’s been really awesome to work with a bunch of great designers. Randi Rahm was certainly completely open. Issey Miyake was fantastic for the Radio City show (Porter was a study in white). Christian Siriano, the fact that he did this custom gown in one week, was incredible after saying, ‘Absolutely. There’s no question we’ll do this.’ Michael Kors has been the most gracious human. So has Tom Ford.”

Porter said he’s just getting started in terms of pushing along the conversation.

“People are actually listening,” he said. “I hope it opens up a dialogue of healing. I will always continue to do me. If there’s anything I’ve learned in the 49 years that I’ve lived on this planet, is that being authentic is the only version of the story that anybody should be.”

Porter has always been a fashion lover. This year, he was an ambassador for the Council of Fashion Designers of America for men’s fashion week in New York and attended a variety of shows featuring a variety of looks, from traditional to gender fluid.

Now that awards season is over, and the fashion week cycle is finishing up in Paris, Porter said he’ll continue to wear whatever he likes, with a great number of designers on board to help with pulls from their lines and custom outfits.

“Pre-Golden Globes it was difficult,” he said of options available to him, considering that he’s not sample size. “After the Golden Globes it has not been difficult. You work with the people who work with you. You walk through the doors that are open. I’m never a beggar.”

In real life, or at least on live TV during the Oscars, Helen Mirren appeared ready for change, noting that both she and her co-presenter, Jason Momoa, were dressed in pink.

“It just goes to show, doesn’t it, that these days a Hawaiian god and a very mature Englishwoman can actually wear the same color. We can both wear pink,” she said to claps.

Momoa agreed: “Finally. The times are changin’.”

Pelé was simply “The King.” He embraced “the beautiful game” of soccer in his 1958 World Cup debut for Brazil and never really let go.
He won a record three World Cups and was widely regarded as one of his sport’s greatest players. His majestic and galvanizing presence set him among the most recognizable figures in the world.
Pelé died Thursday at 82. He had undergone treatment for colon cancer since 2021.
Pelé was among the game’s most prolific scorers and spent nearly two decades enchanting fans and dazzling opponents. His grace, athleticism and moves on soccer’s highest stage transfixed all. He orchestrated a fast, fluid style of play that revolutionized the sport — a flair that personified Brazilian elegance on the field.
He carried his country to soccer’s heights and became a global ambassador for his sport in a journey that began on the streets of Sao Paulo state, where he would kick a sock stuffed with newspapers or rags.
“Pelé changed everything. He transformed football into art, entertainment,” Neymar, a fellow Brazilian soccer player, said on Instagram. “Football and Brazil elevated their standing thanks to the King! He is gone, but his magic will endure. Pelé is eternal!”
In the conversation about soccer’s greatest player, only the late Diego Maradona, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are mentioned alongside him.
Different sources, counting different sets of games, list Pelé’s goal totals anywhere between 650 (league matches) to 1,281 (all senior matches, some against low-level competition). When Maradona once interviewed Pelé, he playfully asked the Brazilian how he accumulated so many goals.
The player who would be dubbed “The King” was introduced to the world at 17 at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, the youngest player ever at the tournament.
Pelé was the emblem of his country’s World Cup triumph of 1970 in Mexico. He scored in the final and set up Carlos Alberto with a nonchalant pass for the last goal in a 4-1 victory over Italy.
The image of Pelé in a bright-yellow Brazil jersey, with the No. 10 stamped on the back, remains alive with soccer fans everywhere. As does his trademark goal celebration — a leap with a right fist thrust high above his head.
Pelé’s fame was such that in 1967 factions of a civil war in Nigeria agreed to a brief cease-fire so he could play an exhibition match in the country. He was knighted by Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II in 1997. When Pelé visited Washington to help popularize the game in North America, it was the U.S. president who stuck out his hand first.
“You don’t need to introduce yourself because everyone knows who Pelé is,” Ronald Reagan said.
Pelé was Brazil’s first modern Black national hero but rarely spoke about racism in a country where the rich and powerful tend to hail from the white minority.
Opposing fans taunted Pelé with monkey chants at home and all over the world.
“He said that he would never play if he had to stop every time he heard those chants,” said Angelica Basthi, one of Pelé’s biographers. “He is key for Black people’s pride in Brazil, but never wanted to be a flagbearer.”
Pelé’s life after soccer took many forms. He was a politician — Brazil’s Extraordinary Minister for Sport — a wealthy businessman, and an ambassador for UNESCO and the United Nations.
He had roles in movies, soap operas and even composed songs and recorded CDs of popular Brazilian music.
Pelé was an ambassador for his sport until his final years but as his health deteriorated his travels and appearances became less frequent. After needing a hip replacement, he started using a cane.
He was often seen in a wheelchair during his final years and did not attend a ceremony to unveil a statue of him representing Brazil’s 1970 World Cup team.
“He gets very shy, he gets very embarrassed,” his son Edinho told Globoesporte.com. “He doesn’t want to go out.”
Pelé spent his 80th birthday with a few relatives.
Pelé spent a month hospitalized in 2021 after surgery to remove a tumor from his colon. Pelé said he was ready “to play 90 minutes, plus extra time,” but soon started chemotherapy.
Born Edson Arantes do Nascimento, in the small city of Tres Coracoes in the interior of Minas Gerais state on Oct. 23, 1940, Pelé grew up shining shoes to buy his modest soccer gear. His father was also a player.
Pelé’s talent drew notice when he was 11, and a local professional player brought him to Santos’ youth squads. Despite his youth and 5-foot-8 frame Pelé’ scored against grown men with the same ease he displayed against friends back home. He debuted with the Brazilian club at 15 in 1956, and the club quickly gained worldwide recognition.
The name Pelé came from him mispronouncing the name of a player called Bilé. He later became known simply as ‘O Rei’ – The King.
Pelé went to the 1958 World Cup as a reserve but became a key part for his country’s championship team. His first goal, in which he flicked the ball over the head of a defender and raced around him to volley it home, was voted as one of the best in World Cup history.
“When Pelé scored,” veteran Swedish midfielder Sigge Parling said, “I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding.”
The 1966 World Cup in England — won by the hosts — was a bitter one for Pelé, by then already considered the world’s top player. Brazil was knocked out at the group stage and Pelé, angry at fouls and hard tackles by Portugal, swore it was his last World Cup.
He changed his mind and was rejuvenated in the 1970 World Cup. In a game against England, he struck a header for a certain score, but the great goalkeeper Gordon Banks flipped the ball over the bar in an astonishing move. Pelé likened the save — one of the best in World Cup history — to a “salmon climbing up a waterfall.” Later, he scored the opening goal in the final against Italy, his last World Cup match.
In all, Pelé played 114 matches with Brazil, scoring a record 95 goals — including 77 in official matches. Most of his goals came with Santos, which he led to five national titles, two Copa Libertadores trophies and two club world championships — all in the 1960s.
His run with Santos stretched over three decades until he went into semi-retirement after the 1972 season. Wealthy European clubs tried to sign him, but the Brazilian government intervened to keep him from being sold, declaring him a national treasure.
On the field, Pelé’s energy, vision and imagination drove a gifted Brazilian national team, with intricate passing combinations slicing defenses while leaving room for players to showcase flashy skills.
The fast, fluid style of play exemplified “O Jogo Bonito” — Portuguese for “The Beautiful Game.” And at the center of it all, like a maestro in command of his orchestra, was Pelé. It was his 1977 autobiography, “My Life and the Beautiful Game,” that made the phrase part of soccer’s lexicon.
In 1975, he joined the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League. Although he was past his prime at 34 years old, Pelé briefly gave soccer a higher profile in North America before ending his career on Oct. 1, 1977, in an exhibition between the Cosmos and Santos. Among the dignitaries on hand was perhaps the only other athlete whose renown spanned the globe — Muhammad Ali.
Pelé had two daughters out of wedlock and five children from his first two marriages, to Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi and Assiria Seixas Lemos. He later married businesswoman Marcia Cibele Aoki.

Pelé likened the save — one of the best in World Cup history — to a “salmon climbing up a waterfall.” Later, he scored the opening goal in the final against Italy, his last World Cup match.
In all, Pelé played 114 matches with Brazil, scoring a record 95 goals — including 77 in official matches. Most of his goals came with Santos, which he led to five national titles, two Copa Libertadores trophies and two club world championships — all in the 1960s.
His run with Santos stretched over three decades until he went into semi-retirement after the 1972 season. Wealthy European clubs tried to sign him, but the Brazilian government intervened to keep him from being sold, declaring him a national treasure.
On the field, Pelé’s energy, vision and imagination drove a gifted Brazilian national team, with intricate passing combinations slicing defenses while leaving room for players to showcase flashy skills.
The fast, fluid style of play exemplified “O Jogo Bonito” — Portuguese for “The Beautiful Game.” And at the center of it all, like a maestro in command of his orchestra, was Pelé. It was his 1977 autobiography, “My Life and the Beautiful Game,” that made the phrase part of soccer’s lexicon.
In 1975, he joined the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League. Although he was past his prime at 34 years old, Pelé briefly gave soccer a higher profile in North America before ending his career on Oct. 1, 1977, in an exhibition between the Cosmos and Santos. Among the dignitaries on hand was perhaps the only other athlete whose renown spanned the globe — Muhammad Ali.
Pelé had two daughters out of wedlock and five children from his first two marriages, to Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi and Assiria Seixas Lemos. He later married businesswoman Marcia Cibele Aoki.

Sri Lanka’s inexperienced cricket team overcame a poor start with bat and ball to put on an impressive all-round show Sunday and win the Asia Cup for the sixth time with a 23-run victory over Pakistan.
Bhanuka Rajapaksa hit an unbeaten 71 off 45 balls in Dubai and led Sri Lanka as it recovered from 58-5 to reach 170-6 in the final after Pakistan won the toss and elected to field.
Pakistan crashed to 147 all out off the last balls as its top order continued to struggle against the pace with fast bowler Pramod Madushan claiming 4-34 in only his second T20 international.
Leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga then baffled the lower order with his sharp googlies to accelerate Pakistan’s collapse.
Hasaranga, who earlier scored 36 off 21 balls, had Pakistan’s top-scorer Mohammad Rizwan (55) caught in the deep in his last over before claiming the wickets of Asif Ali and Khushdil Shah in the same over to finish with 3-27.
“It was all about nerves, I knew the youngsters can always deliver,” Sri Lanka skipper Dasun Shanaka said. “We have players with good caliber, and they stood up well.”
Sri Lanka had an awful bowling start when left-arm fast bowler Dilshan Madushanka conceded nine runs through a no ball and several wides before the 21-year-old’s first legitimate delivery at the sixth attempt.
Madushan, who made his T20 debut in the last Super 4 match against Pakistan on Friday, settled his team’s nerves quickly by claiming the wickets of Babar Azam (5) and Fakhar Azam (0) off successive deliveries inside the powerplay.
Babar was brilliantly snapped up by Madushanka over his head at short fine leg off a hard flick and Fakhar went for a golden duck by dragging the first ball onto his stumps.
Babar, the second-ranked T20 batter, ended the tournament with only 68 runs in six games.
“As a batting unit we didn’t perform according to our potential,” Babar said. “We didn’t finish the way we would have wanted to and gave away 15-20 extra runs … the more you learn from these ups-and-downs is good, but you need to reduce your mistakes.”
Rizwan and Iftikhar Ahmed (32) added 71 runs for the third wicket in almost 10 overs as Sri Lanka kept mounting the pressure by bowling tidily in the middle overs.
Madushan broke the stand in his return spell as Pakistan collapsed from 102-3 to lose its last seven wickets for 45 runs with Sri Lanka fielders holding onto all their catches.
Earlier, Pakistan’s fearsome pace attack, led by Haris Rauf (3-29), had Sri Lanka in trouble inside the first nine overs before Rajapaksa and Hasaranga led the recovery.
Rajapaksa hit six fours and three sixes in his innings.
Fast bowler Naseem Shah (1-40) had Kusal Mendis clean bowled off the first ball with a stunning inswinging delivery while Rauf dismissed Pathum Nissanka and Danushka Gunathilaka.
But Rajapaksa and Hasaranga counterattacked after having negotiated the spin threat of Shadab Khan (1-28). Surprisingly Babar used his premium left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz for only one over which went for three runs as both Sri Lanka batters cut loose against the pace of Shah and Mohammad Hasnain (0-41).
Pakistan was scrappy in the field as Rajapaksa was dropped either side of his half century by Shadab in the deep. Rauf had Hasaranga caught behind in the 15th over, but Rajapaksa added a further 54 runs in the last five overs with Chamika Karunaratne, who made 14 not out.
Rajapaksa provided Sri Lanka with a late flourish when he smashed Shah for a boundary off the penultimate ball and then smashed a six over extra cover to give Sri Lanka a strong total to defend.
Sri Lanka made a stunning comeback with five successive wins in the tournament after getting beaten by Afghanistan in its opening game. Sri Lanka also beat Pakistan in the last Super 4 game.

Mislav Oršić must wish he could play English teams every week.
The Croatia forward ran from the halfway line and produced a deft finish in the 13th minute to lead Dinamo Zagreb to a surprising 1-0 win over Chelsea in their opening Group E match in the Champions League on Tuesday.
Add that goal to Oršić’s feats against English clubs in the Europa League: a winner against West Ham last season and a hat trick to eliminate Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham in 2020-21.
It marked a memorable start by Dinamo to its first group-stage campaign in Europe’s top competition since 2019-20, having reached this point by coming through three qualifying rounds.
As for Chelsea, it was the latest disappointing result in an unconvincing start to the season for a club that spent nearly $300 million on refreshing its squad in the summer transfer window.
The two-time European champions dominated the match in the Croatian capital but were let down by poor finishing, which dovetailed with scrambling defense and some great saves by Dominik Livaković for the hosts.
“We are clearly not where we need to be, or where we can be,” said Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel, whose team has already lost to Leeds and Southampton in the Premier League.
Asked specifically what he didn’t like about Chelsea’s performance, Tuchel said: “At the moment, everything is missing.”
In the second half, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang — making his debut for Chelsea after a deadline-day move from Barcelona and wearing a mask to protect his injured cheek — had a goal disallowed for a narrow offside against Ben Chilwell in the build-up. Then, in a frantic finish, Reece James smashed a shot against the post before Livaković made a stunning double stop to deny Mason Mount then Hakim Ziyech.
Ultimately, the smash-and-grab win was earned thanks to the early goal by Oršić, who met a headed flick-on by Bruno Petković in midfield by chesting the ball forward inside his own half past Chelsea defender Wesley Fofana and racing clear of the newly signed French defender toward goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga.
As he approached Kepa, Oršić lifted the ball over the keeper and it bobbled into the net.
Dinamo looked dangerous in the rare attacks it had in a performance underpinned by defensive discipline and, from one counterattack, Stefan Ristovski powered in a rising shot that was tipped onto the crossbar by Kepa, who was selected ahead of Edouard Mendy.
“It’s an underperformance from us,” Tuchel said. “We have the same story as always — we have an OK start, we don’t finish our half-chances, we don’t feel it when the game is already there to put to bed in the first 15-20 minutes, then we concede one counter-attack which is far too easy.
“And from there, we struggled.”

Remember that time, not so long ago, when there was a crisis at Manchester United?
After four straight wins, it seems like a dim and distant memory.
The latest sign that United is well on the road to recovery came on Sunday with a 3-1 win over Arsenal, whose 100% start to the season came crashing to an end.
There were still anti-Glazer chants inside and outside Old Trafford — it feels like they are here to stay, whether the team wins or loses — but they are now accompanied by frequent and jubilant roars for goals.
Two of them were scored in the second half by Marcus Rashford to sweep United to victory after Arsenal pulled it back to 1-1 through Bukayo Saka, but the opening goal felt the most significant.
Antony, United’s latest big signing from Ajax for $95 million, marked his first match in English soccer with a goal from a curling, first-time finish in the 35th minute, crowning a performance that featured a slew of jinks, feints and exaggerated stepovers that thrilled home fans. He came off in the 58th to a standing ovation to be replaced by Cristiano Ronaldo, who again had to settle for a starting spot on the bench.
Since that humiliating 4-0 loss at Brentford that sparked a crisis and some doubts around the wisdom of hiring Erik ten Hag as manager, United has beaten Liverpool, Southampton, Leicester and now Arsenal, the league leader.
After six games, United is only three points behind Arsenal and two behind Manchester City, the title favorite.
How quickly things have turned around.

Manchester United secured its third straight win in the Premier League by beating Leicester 1-0 on Thursday, with Cristiano Ronaldo again only making a late appearance off the bench.
Jadon Sancho finished off a flowing move on the break for the only goal of the game in the 23rd minute as United’s players backed up victories over Liverpool and Southampton to put their early-season crisis behind them.
“It is another step forward,” United manager Erik ten Hag said.
It was only 10 days ago that United went into its home game against Liverpool on the back of back-to-back defeats to open the season with doubts swirling around the suitability of Ten Hag — its recently hired coach from Ajax — and his new signings.
Those doubts have pretty much disappeared, with United playing with more confidence and the additions of Casemiro — a second-half substitute like Ronaldo — and Antony — who wasn’t available after completing his move from Ajax on Thursday — strengthening the team. Back-to-back clean sheets is a big positive, too.
Ronaldo might yet play a significant part this season after failing to secure a move away in the transfer market that shut soon after the full-time whistle. He came on in the 68th minute and looked lively, an acrobatic bicycle kick flying just wide.
“Once we have Cristiano Ronaldo and Casemiro getting fitter, it will get better still,” Ten Hag said. “We need not only a team, we need a squad.”
In the end, Sancho’s goal separated the teams and it came after United claimed possession following a Leicester goal kick. Bruno Fernandes found Marcus Rashford in a central position and he slipped in Sancho, who rounded goalkeeper Danny Ward and slotted the ball into an empty net.
Leicester is now the Premier League’s crisis club, with just one point from its first five games and two points adrift in last place. The pressure is rising on its manager, Brendan Rodgers, who grumbled after the match about the club’s failure to strengthen the squad in the summer transfer.
Leicester only signed one outfield player, unheralded defender Wout Faes from French club Reims, and he only arrived on deadline day to fill the gap left by the departure of Wesley Fofana to Chelsea.
“With the greatest respect,” Rodgers said, “we have not had the help in the market this team needed.”
The hosts only seriously threatened United goalkeeper David De Gea once and that was from a free kick, which James Maddison whipped over the defensive wall and brought out a fine one-handed save. James Justin blazed over in stoppage time with Leicester’s other good chance.
United will face a bigger challenge on Sunday, when Arsenal — with its 100% record — visits Old Trafford.
“It is a good test to see where we are,” Ten Hag said.

Erling Haaland is taking English soccer by storm.
Back-to-back hat tricks. Nine goals in five games. No player has ever made as good a start to the Premier League as the towering Norway striker.
Haaland’s latest three-goal haul came in the first half of City’s 6-0 thrashing of Nottingham Forest on Tuesday, three days after achieving the same feat in the second half against Crystal Palace.
City was banking on Haaland being the heir to long-time striker Sergio Aguero and it’s already looking as if that is the case.
Aguero previously held the record for most goals in a player’s first five Premier League appearances, with eight along with former Coventry striker Mick Quinn (from the early 1990s). Haaland has bettered that, and surely more scoring records will fall if he continues like this.
For example, can he become the first player to score 40 goals in a single top-flight campaign in England since Tottenham’s Jimmy Greaves in 1960-61?
“What Haaland wants is to win titles,” Guardiola said of the striker who scored with his left foot, right foot and head against Forest. “Knowing him, he would not be happy to break records if we don’t win titles.
“Sergio is a legend — no one can break his position in the hearts of Man City fans. But Erling has the quality to be there.”
City is the red-hot favorite to win the Premier League again with Haaland leading the line and is unbeaten with four wins from five games.
Even its back-up striker is scoring, with Julian Alvarez — an offseason arrival from River Plate — marking his first start with two goals in the second half. Joao Cancelo also scored with a blast from outside the box.
Still, the champions aren’t top. That honor remains with Arsenal.
PERFECT START
Arsenal has matched its best ever start to a Premier League season after securing a fifth straight win to open the season by beating Aston Villa 2-1.
Gabriel Martinelli’s 77th-minute goal clinched victory at Emirates Stadium after Arsenal was pegged back by conceding a goal straight from a corner by Douglas Luiz, who did the same in an English League Cup match last week, too.
That came against the run of play, with Arsenal dominating the game but only having Gabriel Jesus’ 30th-minute goal — his third of the season — to show for it.
“That is the spirit we need to keep for the whole season,” Martinelli said.
Villa has lost four of its five games, leaving manager Steven Gerrard under pressure.
LATE, LATE GOAL
Liverpool is battling hard to keep up with the fierce pace set by Arsenal and City, needing a goal in the eighth minute of stoppage time by Fábio Carvalho to claim a dramatic 2-1 win over Newcastle.
Alexander Isak gave Newcastle the lead in the 38th on his debut following a move from Real Sociedad on Friday for a club-record fee and was denied a second goal by narrow offside call.
Roberto Firmino swept in a finish from Mohamed Salah’s cross to equalize before a penalty-box melee following a corner saw the ball pop up off the shoulder of Salah, and Carvalho — a summer signing from Fulham — reacted quickest to smash into the roof of the net.
“I am not sure everyone in the stadium kept believing but from now on we have to,” Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said. “What a wonderful goal from the little one.”
It was a second straight victory for Liverpool, which opened the season without winning any of its first three games.
SPURS UNBEATEN
Tottenham remained unbeaten after a 1-1 draw at West Ham, for whom club-record signing Lucas Paqueta missed a chance to score a late winner on his debut.
West Ham manager David Moyes said before kickoff that Paqueta had not so much as passed a ball to his new teammates after only completing his 52 million pound ($61.6 million) switch from Lyon on Monday.
With four minutes remaining, Vladimir Coufal pulled the ball back and Paqueta — on as a 67th-minute substitute — got in a mix-up with fellow new signing Emerson Palmieri as they left the ball to each other, 10 meters from goal, instead of taking a shot. Moyes fell to his knees on the touchline.
An own-goal from Thilo Kehrer gave Tottenham the lead before Tomas Soucek equalized.
In the other game, Bournemouth drew 0-0 at home to Wolverhampton, two days after firing manager Scott Parker.

Erling Haaland scored his first Premier League hat-trick as Manchester City came from two goals down to beat Crystal Palace 4-2 on Saturday.
City trailed 2-0 after just 21 minutes against a clinical Palace side — which was looking to its 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium last season — after an own-goal by John Stones and a header by Joachim Andersen.
It was the fourth Premier League game out of the last six in which City had fallen two goals behind, but Pep Guardiola’s team had not lost any of the previous three and went on to win this one in style.
After Bernardo Silva pulled one back eight minutes into the second half, Haaland took over as his first home goals for City came in a hurry. He netted three in the space of 20 minutes to make it six in his first four Premier League matches.
Patrick Vieira was forced to name a starting 11 without Wilfried Zaha due to injury, but the absence of the star forward did not prevent Palace from storming into an early lead as Eberechi Eze’s free kick struck both Kyle Walker and Stones as it spun into the net.
Things got worse for City in the 22nd minute from another set piece. It was Eze again with a corner from which Andersen was left unmarked to power in a header.
Guardiola had been planning two substitutions early in the second half with Ilkay Gundogan and Julian Alvarez both stripped and ready to go, but they sat back down after Silva got City back into it in the 53rd minute.
The Portugal international cut in from the right before hitting a low shot which deflected off Jeffrey Schlupp on its way in.
Gundogan and Alvarez did come on just after the hour and Alvarez quickly made an impact as City leveled in the 62nd. He flicked on a deep cross to Phil Foden, who chipped the ball back in for Haaland, who got across Marc Guehi to head in his first Etihad goal.
Eight minutes later he had his second. From a short corner, Alvarez fed Silva who pulled the ball back for Stones and he rolled it across for Haaland to poke home from a yard out.
Haaland sealed his hat-trick with 10 minutes to go. Silva’s through ball found his run perfectly, and the Norwegian had the strength to hold off Joel Ward before firing into the bottom corner.
City now has 10 points from four games, with Palace left on four points.

Raheem Sterling’s first goals for Chelsea gave the 10-man Blues a 2-1 victory over winless Leicester in the English Premier League on Saturday.
Sterling’s second half double proved decisive at Stamford Bridge as the hosts overcame the early sending off of England midfielder Conor Gallagher.
Manager Thomas Tuchel was also absent as he was serving a touchline ban following his confrontation with Antonio Conte in the opening home match against Tottenham, while Gallagher was dismissed in the 28th minute after getting two yellow cards.
Chelsea was awarded an early penalty when Ruben Loftus-Cheek went down in the box, but referee Paul Tierney overturned his decision after Kai Havertz was adjudged to have been offside in the buildup.
Seven minutes before the break, the visitors thought they took the lead when Harvey Barnes headed home, but the effort was ruled out for a foul on Blues goalkeeper Edouard Mendy.
The hosts came close to breaking the deadlock four minutes later when Reece James struck the post with an effort from Sterling’s cross, then Jamie Vardy shot wide at the other end after good work by Youri Tielemans.
A little more than a minute after the restart, Sterling broke the deadlock with a shot from the edge of the area, after being found by Marc Cucurella.
The Blues, who introduced Cesar Azpilicueta at halftime, went from four at the back to three and looked more threatening.
They doubled their lead in the 63rd minute when Sterling tapped in James’ cross at the far post. However, the Foxes pulled one back three minutes later when Barnes beat Mendy at his near post.
Vardy fired a shot into the side-netting and Ayoze Perez came close as the visitors sought an equalizer. However, Chelsea held on for its first home win.
Leicester defender Wesley Fofana was left out of Brendan Rodgers’ squad amid reports he is close to finalizing a transfer to Chelsea.

Liverpool equaled the biggest win in English Premier League history after a 9-0 hammering of promoted Bournemouth on Saturday.
Jurgen Klopp’s side started the campaign slowly, with surprise draws against Fulham and Crystal Palace compounded by Monday’s loss at rival Manchester United. But Liverpool’s fearsome attack looked back to its best at Anfield as the team recorded its first league win and Roberto Firmino and Luis Diaz both grabbed two goals.
It’s only the fifth time a team scored nine goals in the league, with Man United (twice) and Leicester the only previous teams to win 9-0.
Firmino, starting in place of suspended summer signing Darwin Nunez, produced a stunning first-half display, which began with Diaz heading home his clipped cross within three minutes of the kickoff.
Firmino then provided the assist for Harvey Elliott’s first league goal — a fizzing strike from distance that would have been goal of the day were it not for the Trent Alexander-Arnold stunner that followed.
The Brazil forward set up that goal and celebrated one of his own soon after when turning in a deflected cross -- his first league goal at Anfield since December 2020.
Virgil van Dijk powered home Liverpool’s fifth on the stroke of halftime, while the onslaught continued just after the break in the form of Chris Mepham’s own-goal.
Firmino grabbed a second of the afternoon before leaving to a standing ovation.
The goals did not stop there, though, as Fabio Carvalho scored his first for the club and Diaz grabbed his second.

Manchester United’s stand-in captain Bruno Fernandes made it back-to-back wins for Erik ten Hag’s team by scoring the only goal in a 1-0 victory over Southampton in the Premier League on Saturday.
Wearing the captain’s armband in place of the still-benched Harry Maguire, Fernandes steered in a cross from Diogo Dalot in the 55th minute as United followed up Monday’s win over Liverpool with another morale-boosting performance.
Having started the season with two straight losses — including a 4-0 drubbing at Brentford — United has now won consecutive league matches for the first time since February.
It was also the team’s first clean sheet of the season, thanks in part to David de Gea’s reflex save to keep out a header from Joe Aribo in the 66th.
It’s a result that will give a bit more breathing space to Ten Hag, the Dutch manager who faced a torrent of criticism and skepticism after the team’s dismal start to the campaign.
Ten Hag’s decisions to leave Maguire and star forward Cristiano Ronaldo on the bench were vindicated once again, with center-back pairing Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane looking solid in defense.
United did struggle to create quality chances in the first half, although Ten Hag was shaking his head in disbelief that his team didn’t go ahead in the 20th minute when they had three shots on goal from close range in the span of a few seconds.
Anthony Elanga’s effort from a tight angle was saved by goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu before Fernandes and Christian Eriksen both had their follow-up shots blocked by diving defenders.
Southampton had its best first-half chance on the half-hour mark when a corner fell to Armel Bella-Kotchap at the back post, but he lifted it over the crossbar.
United started stronger in the second half and got the goal after a well-worked move down the right flank. Dalot lifted a cross into the area and Fernandes was on hand to sidefoot it inside the far post.
Ronaldo and United’s new signing Casemiro — the Portugal star’s former teammate at Real Madrid — both came on in the second half.
Substitute Sekou Mara had two chances to equalize for Southampton in injury time, but his spectacular overhead kick was blocked by Dalot and he sidefooted another effort wide of the post a minute later.

Finally, there are signs of life at Manchester United.
Against a backdrop of protests against the club’s ownership, United delivered a performance of intensity and spirit to beat fierce rival Liverpool 2-1 on Monday and claim its first points in the Premier League this season.
Composed finishes by Jadon Sancho in the 16th minute and Marcus Rashford in the 53rd earned a victory at Old Trafford that will bring some respite for under-pressure manager Erik ten Hag, who made a huge statement in his team selection by dropping star striker Cristiano Ronaldo and club captain Harry Maguire and was validated.
“I wanted a different attitude and that is what I saw them bring on the pitch,” said Ten Hag, who has started his tenure at United amid something of a crisis at England’s biggest club. “But it’s only the start.”
Suddenly, the heat is on Liverpool — widely expected to be a title contender again this season — with Jürgen Klopp’s team still waiting for a win after three games and now languishing behind United in the standings on just two points.
Mohamed Salah scored an 81st-minute consolation but it was another below-par display from Liverpool after draws with Fulham and Crystal Palace, even if this was a first league loss in 2022.
“In the warm-up, it was the quietest I have heard this stadium and they wanted something to lift them,” Liverpool defender Andrew Robertson said. “And we gave them it.”
What is historically the biggest game in English soccer was preceded by a pre-match protest by thousands of United fans angry at the direction and state of the club under its owners of 17 years, the Glazer family.
The supporters called for the U.S-based Glazers to sell the club as they walked to Old Trafford then gathered on the concourse outside the storied stadium, in front of a large police presence. Many lingered as the match began.
The pressure was on United after losses to Brighton (2-1) and Brentford (4-0) to open the season, and the players fed off a frenzied atmosphere that seemed to affect Liverpool early on.
“The start of the game was exactly what everyone expected, what United fans expected. They were after us,” Klopp said. “They started slightly more aggressive than us.”
Lisandro Martinez, an offseason signing at center back who has come under enormous criticism in recent days, was particularly impressive and set the tone by clattering into Salah in the first minute, then barging into the Liverpool forward after getting up off the ground. Later in the first half, Raphael Varane, who replaced Maguire, virtually rugby-tackled Luis Diaz to the ground, to roars of approval from United’s fans even if it earned him a booking.
Sancho’s goal came in United’s best spell of the game, the winger showing great composure to trick James Milner by feigning to shoot, cut back inside and place a shot into the corner as Virgil van Dijk bizarrely stood motionless in front of him. It was the seventh straight Premier League match that Liverpool had fallen behind.
The stadium erupted again when Anthony Martial, a halftime substitute, played through Rashford and the striker sprinted toward the area before placing a calm finish inside the near post.
United had to defend stoutly at times but hung on to end an eight-match winless run against Liverpool and a losing streak of four matches in the league stretching back to the end of last season.
It’s down to United to string a run of similar battling performances together, starting at Southampton next weekend. Ten Hag will have Casemiro, whose $60 million signing from Real Madrid was completed Monday, available for that game and the Brazil midfielder was presented on the field before kickoff.
With more signings potentially arriving before the end of the transfer window, things might be looking up for the record 20-time English champions.
“We just have to produce like today in every single game,” Sancho said.

Manchester City was given a major scare by Newcastle before coming from behind to draw 3-3 in a thrilling Premier League game on Sunday.
City needed goals in the space of four minutes after the hour mark from Erling Haaland and Bernardo Silva to salvage a point at St. James’ Park and maintain the unbeaten start to its title defense.
Newcastle battered City for much of the first half and just after halftime, responding to going behind to Ilkay Gundogan’s fifth-minute strike with goals from Miguel Almiron, Callum Wilson and then a stunning free kick from Kieran Trippier in the 54th.
Rather than opt for damage limitation, Newcastle — inspired by the individual brilliance of Allan Saint-Maximin — decided attack was the best form of defense and it nearly paid off.
Ultimately it was a goal by Silva, starting for the first time in the league this season after being linked with a move to Barcelona in the summer, that saved City and it came off a brilliant through-ball from Kevin De Bruyne that took out three Newcastle players — going through the legs of one of them.
Newcastle also stayed unbeaten after three games and, funded by the riches of Saudi Arabia, will be proud of a statement display against the champions.
City started strongly, and Silva and Haaland had already combined ominously to allow Rodri to whistle a long-range strike over Nick Pope’s crossbar when the midfielder was allowed time and space to deliver a cross for Gundogan to control and fire past Pope.
The England goalkeeper had to save with his legs from De Bruyne and Phil Foden in quick succession with the visitors utterly dominant, although the home side should have leveled when Saint-Maximin cut the ball back for Almiron, who skied his shot.
Then Newcastle took over. Ederson had to save at full stretch to keep out Saint-Maximin before substitute Ruben Dias — on for the injured Nathan Ake — deflected Wilson’s attempt wide.
The respite proved temporary. Saint-Maximin tricked his way past Kyle Walker and Rodri down the left to cross to the far post where Almiron slid in to turn the ball home. The goal was ruled offside but it was overturned on review.
That Almiron was the scorer was poignant, given he was mocked by City midfielder Jack Grealish in post-title celebrations in May.
Joao Cancelo had to come to Ederson’s rescue after he had rashly raced from his line to confront Almiron and was easily rounded, but the Brazil goalkeeper was picking the ball out of his net once again six minutes before the break. Saint-Maximin cut inside and fed Wilson, who touched the ball back inside past Dias before dispatching it into the net with the outside of his right foot.
Haaland was unfortunate not to drag the visitors back level within seven minutes of the restart when his shot was tipped onto the foot of a post by Pope, and his misery was compounded two minutes later when the home side extended their lead.
John Stones was penalized for bringing down the flying Saint-Maximin 22 meters out and Trippier’s free kick gave Ederson little chance.
Haaland blasted City back into it from close range from Rodri’s flick back into the area and should have helped himself to a second three minutes later, but was denied by Pope’s legs.
City was level, however, seconds later when De Bruyne picked out Silva’s run.
Trippier was shown a straight red card by referee Jarred Gillett for a cynical trip on De Bruyne, but the official was advised to review the incident and reduced the punishment to a yellow.

A bad error by goalkeeper Edouard Mendy prompted a collapse by Chelsea in a 3-0 loss at Leeds on Sunday featuring a first Premier League goal by American winger Brenden Aaronson.
The late sending-off of center back Kalidou Koulibaly completed a miserable afternoon at a lively Elland Road for Chelsea, which fell to a first loss of the season.
It was Aaronson who applied pressure on Mendy after the Senegal international received a back pass in the 33rd minute. Mendy took a slightly heavy touch and tried to go around Aaronson, who dispossessed him and walked the ball into the net to make it 1-0.
Rodrigo glanced home a header from Jack Harrison’s free kick in the 37th minute and the roles were reversed for the third goal in the 69th, when Rodrigo arrived in the area to meet a cross with a mis-hit shot that was turned in from close range by Harrison.
Koulibaly, one of Chelsea’s offseason signings, received his second yellow card in the 84th for pulling back the jersey of substitute Joe Gelhardt.
Chelsea’s poor performance contrasted sharply with its impressive display in a 2-2 draw with Tottenham last weekend and highlighted a number of weaknesses in its squad.
Notably in attack, where manager Thomas Tuchel looks to be short after letting go Romelu Lukaku and Timo Werner and only bringing in Raheem Sterling from Manchester City. Sterling had a goal disallowed in the first half and also missed a great early chance.
Chelsea also has a shortage of center backs — the suspension of Koulibaly won’t help — as well as issues in midfield, with N’Golo Kante and Mateo Kovacic injured.
Leeds has opened with two wins and a draw in manager Jesse Marsch’s first full season in charge.
Spain striker Rodrigo has four goals, making him the top scorer in the league.

Two glaring misses then a red card for a reckless headbutt.
It was a home debut to forget for Liverpool’s big offseason signing, Darwin Núñez.
Fortunately for the Reds, another South American came to the rescue at Anfield as a dazzling individual goal by Luis Díaz salvaged a 1-1 draw against Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Monday.
In his first competitive start for Liverpool, Núñez lost control after jostling with Joachim Andersen off the ball and thrust his head into the face of the Palace defender, with referee Paul Tierney watching on close by in the 57th minute.
The red card was immediately brandished and Núñez had to be calmed down by his teammates as he attempted to confront Tierney. Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp blanked Núñez as the Uruguay striker headed down the tunnel.
“It’s a red card,” Klopp said. “He was provoked all the time but that is not how to behave.”
Núñez, an offseason signing from Benfica, earned his first start after a couple of impressive, goalscoring displays off the bench in the Community Shield against Manchester City and then against Fulham, and also because Roberto Firmino was missing through injury.
He missed a very presentable early chance against Palace by miscuing a close-range volley at the back post, and then hit the post from a similar range in the final minute of the first half.
Maybe some frustration had set by the time he was red-carded. As they jostled at the edge of Palace’s penalty area, Núñez threw his head back at Andersen and missed. Then, when confronted moments later by the aggrieved defender, Núñez turned into Andersen and butted him square in the face.
Already trailing because of Wilfried Zaha’s 32nd-minute goal, Liverpool was really up against it. But even down to 10 men, Klopp’s team still dominated possession and Díaz earned his team a point by cutting in from the left, slipping between two defenders, and curling a shot into the far corner in front of the Kop. The Colombia international’s goal came four minutes after the red card.
“Sometimes you need a moment of brilliance,” Liverpool midfielder James Milner said, “and when you have players like Luis on the pitch, he can create something out of nothing. It was an incredible goal.”
Palace relied almost exclusively on the counterattack throughout the match and it was from that means that Zaha opened the scoring, breaking the offside trap to latch onto Eberechi Eze’s through-ball and curl a finish into the far corner.
Zaha missed a great chance to snatch a win when he stretched to meet a cross late in the game and hit the post.
Liverpool has now drawn its first two games — Klopp’s team was held 2-2 by Fulham in the opening weekend — and is already four points behind Manchester City and Arsenal, the early pacesetters.
Its third match will be at Old Trafford next Monday against a beleaguered Manchester United team that has lost both of its games.
Núñez will be suspended for that, while Klopp is set to be without a slew of key players, with the likes of Thiago Alcantara, Diogo Jota, Ibrahima Konaté and Joel Matip currently out injured. Firmino missed the game as a precaution, according to Liverpool, so could be fit in a week’s time.
“Everything went against us during the week,” Klopp said. “It was crazy — it was like a witch was in the building. Every time somebody else had problems and then putting in such a performance, especially in the circumstances, I’m really proud.”

Antonio Conte and Thomas Tuchel were both sent off after clashing following the final whistle of a feisty 2-2 draw between Chelsea and Tottenham featuring an equalizer in the sixth minute of stoppage time by Spurs striker Harry Kane on Sunday.
As they shook hands on the field, Tuchel seemed to not let go of his grip and intimated that Conte look him in the eyes. Pushing and shoving ensued, just as there had been between the two managers in the technical area during the match at Stamford Bridge. They were then shown red cards.
Conte celebrated Tottenham’s first equalizer, by Pierre-Emile Højbjerg in the 68th minute, by barging into the chest of Tuchel, sparking a melee among the two sets of coaching staff.
Then, after Reece James put Chelsea back in front in the 77th, Tuchel set off on a sprint past Conte and down the touchline, clenching his fist in pure delight.
Kane’s goal came in the sixth of seven added-on minutes, the striker glancing in a header that took a touch off the thigh of James before going into the net.
Kalidou Koulibaly had put Chelsea ahead in the 19th minute by meeting a deep corner from Marc Cucurella with a stunning volley that flew high into the net for his first goal since joining in the offseason from Napoli.
Tottenham, which only came to life after the introduction of Richarlison, ended a run of five straight losses to Chelsea in all competitions but remained stuck on just one victory at Stamford Bridge since the Premier League started in 1992.
Both teams have four points from two games.

Manchester United plumbed new depths with a 4-0 loss at Brentford on Saturday to send Erik ten Hag’s team into meltdown after just two games of the Premier League season.
Through a mixture of defensive ineptitude and Brentford’s opportunism, United was 4-0 down at halftime for the first time in a Premier League game.
Mistakes by goalkeeper David De Gea gifted the first two goals to Josh Dasilva and Mathias Jensen, Ben Mee nodded in the third at a corner and Bryan Mbeumo hit a slick fourth on the counterattack on a chastening afternoon for the visitors.
Ten Hag, who joined from Ajax in the offseason, had insisted before the game that he was not panicking despite United’s lack of new signings but the Dutchman must be worried about this humiliating result, coming a week after a 2-1 home loss to Brighton.
It was a defeat largely of United’s own making.
Ten Hag had turned to Cristiano Ronaldo to lead the attack, having started the Portugal star on the bench against Brighton.
But the problems were all at the other end, as United imploded after only 10 minutes thanks to the first mistake from De Gea.
The Spaniard allowed Dasilva’s weak long-range shot to squirm through his hands and roll into the net.
De Gea was at fault again eight minutes later, passing to the under-pressure Christian Eriksen as United attempted to play out from the back.
Jensen was alive to the unravelling situation in the United defense and nipped in to rob Eriksen, cut inside and double the lead.
It was a sweet moment for the Bees fans, with Eriksen having spent the second half of last season with Brentford following his recovery from cardiac arrest, only to opt for supposed bigger and better things at United.
It certainly does not look like panning out that way for the Denmark international just yet.
The drinks break in sweltering conditions gave Ten Hag the chance to try to sort out the mess unfolding in front of him, while Bees boss Thomas Frank brought out a tactics board.
There was no change and on the half hour, Mee, an offseason signing from Burnley, bundled in a header at the far post after United failed to deal with a corner headed back into the danger area by Ivan Toney.
Five minutes later, Toney was given space to race forward down the left and tee up strike partner Mbeumo, who beat Luke Shaw before firing home.
With the heat undoubtedly a factor, United got some respite in the second half and Eriksen managed a couple of attempts on goal — a header held by goalkeeper David Raya and a volley skewed wide — both to loud cheers from the partying Brentford fans.

Gabriel Jesus didn’t take long to make an impression at the Emirates stadium.
The Brazil striker marked his home debut for Arsenal with two goals and two assists in a 4-2 win against Leicester in the Premier League on Saturday.
Jesus, who joined from Manchester City as Arsenal’s marquee summer signing so far, opened his account for the Gunners in the 23rd minute with a brilliant, curling finish. He got his second in the 35th from a header and had several chances to finish the game at Emirates Stadium with a hat trick.
The two times Leicester found itself back in the match, Arsenal responded right away.
The visitors made it 2-1 from an own goal by William Saliba in the 53rd, but Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka restored the home side’s two-goal cushion two minutes later. Xhaka scored after Jesus poked a loose ball into his path after Leicester goalkeeper Danny Ward failed to hold on to a routine cross into the box and collided with defender Wesley Fofana.
Leicester attacking midfielder James Maddison made it 3-2 in the 74th when he sent a low shot through the legs of Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale.
A nervous murmur went through the crowd, but the Arsenal team didn’t panic as it did in similar situations in recent seasons. Jesus drove forward just a minute later and squared the ball to forward Gabriel Martinelli, who fired a left-footed shot from just outside the area to beat Ward at the back post to make it 4-2.
Leicester also had a penalty decision overturned just before halftime after the referee first pointed to the spot and then was asked to review a coming together of Ramsdale and Leicester forward Jamie Vardy in the box.
On a hot day when the mercury hit around 33 C (91 F), six goals and the pace of the game took a lot out of the players and water breaks were needed in each half. The result means that Arsenal has won both of its opening league games, with Leicester drawing its first match.
Jesus was the focus of Arsenal’s attack throughout the match, with teammates trying to get him the ball at every opportunity. For his first goal, he took one touch after receiving a pass from Xhaka, set himself and then bent a shot that took a slight deflection to sail in past Ward.
Jesus got a bit of help for his second from Vardy. The Leicester forward flicked the ball backward across the face of goal from a corner, and Jesus headed into an empty net at the back post.
The striker nearly scored a hat trick before halftime when he dominated Leicester defender Jonny Evans with his back to goal, spun around him into the box and fired a low shot saved by Ward. He had multiple chances in the second half as well.
Unlike Arsenal, Leicester has been very quiet in the transfer market. The team only announced its first signing of the transfer window on the eve of Saturday’s match. Alex Smithies, a 32-year-old backup goalkeeper who most recently played for Cardiff, signed with the Foxes on a two-year deal.

Erling Haaland might not hog all of Manchester City’s goals this season, after all.
Ilkay Gundogan, Kevin De Bruyne and Phil Foden were City’s scorers — along with an own-goal — in a 4-0 win over Bournemouth in the Premier League on Saturday, with Haaland barely getting a sight on goal at Etihad Stadium.
The Norway striker scored both of City’s goals in its opening-weekend 2-0 win at West Ham but was mostly crowded out a week later as Bournemouth sat deep with plenty of men behind the ball in a match that resembled an attack vs defense training exercise.
City’s midfielders reaped the benefits of the extra focus on Haaland.
Gundogan’s goal did involve City’s new star striker, with Haaland holding off his marker with his back to goal and clipping a ball through to the Germany midfielder. Gundogan’s left-footed finish found the bottom corner in the 19th for his 50th goal for City.
De Bruyne scored the pick of the goals, the playmaker cutting inside on a counterattack led by Foden in the 31st, beating a defender and bending his shot with the outside of his right foot into the far corner.
De Bruyne returned the favor for Foden six minutes later, slipping a brilliant pass through the legs of a defender and into the path of his teammate, who took a touch and fired in a deflected shot that beat goalkeeper Mark Travers.
Haaland’s best chance fell in the 73rd when he mishit a first-time shot wide from Jack Grealish’s cut-back. The striker was substituted moments later.
The scoring was completed by Jefferson Lerma, who unwittingly turned a cross from Joao Cancelo into his own net from inside Bournemouth’s six-yard box.
It was a wake-up call for Bournemouth after the promoted team started the season with a surprisingly comfortable 2-0 win over Aston Villa last weekend.
City manager Pep Guardiola again chose to start with Bernardo Silva on the bench. The Portugal midfielder has been linked with a move to Barcelona and didn’t start against West Ham, either.

The fake Bhutanese refugees scam has come as a test case for us.
Will Nepali society and politics pass this test and move forward or fail and be pushed further into despondency and restlessness?
The way this scam will be concluded will either raise the trust of people in the Nepali state and politics, albeit a little, or erode it further.
As tricky as this issue is, the time is trickier. Nepal currently is like a petrol tanker carrying ‘highly flammable materials’. Let’s not commit the mistake of shoving a flame on that, and understand the flammability of time.  
Let no one display temerity in the fake Bhutanese refugees scam. That does not mean supporting the anarchist act of parading everyone naked on the streets. That also does not mean putting one’s trust in the street anarchy of ruling someone guilty merely due to accusation by someone.
The main mantra for ending this scam is the clichéd ‘no guilty be spared, no innocent punished!’
Nepal Police Inspector General (IGP) Basanta Kunwar needs to be investigated as per the spirit of this mantra. He will be acquitted if innocent, and punished if guilty.
He is seen to be obstructing investigation on the fake Bhutanese refugees scam for a long time as per our analysis. The role he has played in the scam until now says so. We feel he has committed three unpardonable mistakes until now.
The first, a complaint on behalf of 81 victims was registered when he was chief of the Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office. They had claimed that the racket had collected Rs 130 million from them. They had submitted evidence of transferring money multiple times through the banking system. Members of the racket were arrested but were immediately released upon political pressure.
The second, contact of Kunwar with the members of the racket who were released after arrest is seen to have been established within a few days through the then home secretary Tek Narayan Pandey. So much so, that a member of the racket has even guaranteed financial support for him through Pandey.
The third, a member of the racket in his first statement after arrest accused former home minister and Nepali Congress (NC) leader Bal Krishna Khand of taking Rs 12.50 million from the racket. Recording of statement was stopped for 10 days after that. Khand sent an emissary to strike a deal with the racket members in police custody in those 10 days, and returned the bribe. Nobody took the name of Khand in the statements recorded duly after that.  
Who got this unpardonable crime committed? IGP Kunwar or chief of Kathmandu Police SSP Dan Bahadur Karki or chief of the Kathmandu Valley Police Office (Metro) AIG Shyam Gyawali? If it was committed by officers under Kunwar’s command, he should hold them accountable or be ready to answer himself.
IGP Kunwar needs to be investigated on these three issues and must face the questions raised. Setopati has sought appointment with IGP Kunwar for interview to ask these questions. He has not provided time until now. He is trying to evade these questions, but he cannot.
The questions will walk into the Singha Durbar if IGP Kunwar does not answer these questions, and will stop only after reaching the Home Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office because the buck always stops with the prime minister (PM) in a parliamentary democracy.  
Dear PM, dear home minister—did you stop the recording of statement for 10 days under pressure from coalition partners or for your own interest? Did the police make a mockery of the investigation process to save Khand on your instruction? If not, why have you not held IGP Kunwar accountable for that? Do you endorse the past maneuverings by IGP Kunwar to cover up the scam? Or do you believe that whatever IGP Kunwar has done in this scam until now was right? If yes, do defend him publicly, face all these questions and provide answers.   
IGP Kunwar may remain silent now. He can remain silent as long as you protect him. But you don’t have the choice of remaining silent. Either defend him or suspend him and initiate investigation.
Investigation on IGP Kunwar now is important for both immediate and long-term reasons.   
The immediate importance is due to the fact that investigation into the scam is yet to be completed. More complaints will be lodged, and are arriving. The curtain will be pulled back further in the scam, and more investigation will be necessary. IGP Kunwar will obstruct investigation as long as he remains at the Nepal Police Headquarters.
The role of police will be important not just in additional investigation, but also for creating an environment for impartial conclusion of the case being taken to the court now.
Several people are absconding even now. It is necessary to arrest them and produce them in court. Many witnesses who had testified to the police are absconding; they should also be produced. For example, racket member Sanu Bhandari’s elder brother Raju Bhandari has testified to the police that he had received Rs 3 million of the bribe that was returned. He will be a strong witness in court tomorrow. But he is currently out of contact.
Therefore Nepal Police needs a leadership that will move this investigation ahead in a strong and fair manner.
Its long-term significance is even greater.
Looking from a different perspective, IGP Kunwar’s guilt is less as he is only a product of this decadent system. Maybe he is indeed a good man. He could have been an amazing professional IGP.
But the corrupt and useless system that we have institutionalized in the name of democracy doesn’t want a professional IGP at all. Those in power want a servile IGP, an IGP who would obey their legitimate and illegitimate orders and who would be willing to cover up their sins and misdeeds when necessary.
Does Kunwar need to forsake his professional integrity and shield Congress leaders at any cost just because Bal Krishna Khand made him the top-ranked DIG and Congress made him IGP through its efforts?
In this sense, this useless system institutionalized by the political parties is more guilty than IGP Kunwar.
There is an outward appearance of democracy, but in essence this is such a system of bad governance that wants to install its own people in all key bodies of the state and expects them to play the role of servants. All key organs of the state – police, CIAA, court, Election Commission – have fallen prey to this bad governance.
Political parties and their present top leaders have a key role in institutionalizing and exploiting this system of bad governance in the guise of democracy.
This is what has been holding the Nepali society back now and raising people’s discontent to boiling point. And that is the thing that needs to be changed.
Leaders repeatedly say that things cannot continue as in the past, that they must correct and transform themselves.
It is now time to show whether they are merely speaking or will also change. It is time to become accountable and establish accountability in the main organs of the state.
It is time for departure from the practice of installing one’s men in the main organs of the state and using them as servants to cover up one’s mistakes.
Will you restrain the people, albeit a little, by embracing the different path of accountability from this episode, and instill some hope that things will change, or make them take to the streets with no hope of change?

President Ram Chandra Paudel authenticated the Citizenship Bill that was passed by the previous parliament.
This has created a strange situation—he has authenticated the bill sent by the parliament whose one part (the then House of Representatives) no longer exists.
A new HoR is in existence after the federal election in November 2022. President Paudel has authenticated the bill that was not passed by the new HoR. This should not have happened.   
We have arrived at this situation due to the mistake committed by then president Bidya Devi Bhandari. Current President Paudel has committed another mistake while correcting that mistake on the request of the Cabinet. He has authenticated the bill arguing that he is constitutionally and morally mandated to comply with the Cabinet’s request.
The government that requested for committing this mistake, therefore, must take responsibility for this. The government had the option of taking a new bill to the current HoR and passing it with majority. But the government chose an easy and illegal path on the pretext that the main opposition CPN-UML would protest and even obstruct House proceedings thereby obstructing passage of the bill. 
Legality of the amended Citizenship Act would be tested if anyone moved the Supreme Court (SC) against the authentication. The apex court can rule on the issues including whether the president is mandated to authenticate a bill passed by the House and whether the president can authenticate a bill that the previous president refused to authenticate. The SC can also speak about whether a bill automatically becomes law if the president refuses to authenticate it as mandated by the Constitution. 
The sad part of this is that the country will now have to suffer unnecessary hassle for some time. The country will now be stuck in the dispute as to whether President Paudel was right to authenticate the bill.
Those who had protested against then president Bhandari’s refusal to authenticate the bill, have moral rights to oppose the step of President Paudel. But those who had argued that Bhandari was right to twice refuse to authenticate the bill  passed by the parliament don’t have the rights to protest against the step of Paudel.
What Bhandari did in capacity of president was not just unconstitutional but even unimaginable. Can she refuse to administer oath of office and secrecy pointing she doesn’t like the prime minister elected by the House or not? Can she refuse to administer oath of office and secrecy pointing she doesn’t like the person picked as chief justice (CJ) or chief of any other constitutional body and endorsed by the House after parliamentary hearing or not? Can she refuse to implement any decision made by the Cabinet pointing she doesn’t like the decision?
The answer is straightforward—she cannot.
But she did so and refused to authenticate the bill that was twice sent to her after being passed by the House. She insisted that she was above the parliament. 
The House should either have impeached her or moved the court seeking legal remedy at that time. Her move should have been resisted from the streets if both of those options were not possible because the president does not have the rights to defy the Constitution. But the parties did not choose to politically resist her unconstitutional step or seek legal remedy as the HoR was already dissolved and the country was facing elections. She got away with the crime.
The Constitution of Nepal does not grant any right to the president to take initiative and work. Our Constitution, in that sense, considers the post of president to be absolutely ceremonial. Let us see what the Constitution has to say about the president. Article 61 says four things about the president.
(1) There shall be a President of Nepal.
(2) The President shall be the Head of State of Nepal. He or she shall perform his or her functions in accordance with this Constitution and federal law.
(3) The President shall promote national unity of Nepal.
(4) The main duty of the President shall be to abide by and protect the Constitution.
The Interim Constitution 2007, which was in effect before the current one was promulgated, had mentioned that ‘the main duty of the President shall be to protect and abide by the Constitution.""
The order of protect and abide by was changed in the current Constitution promulgated in 2015, and abide was written first followed by protect.
The spirit of the current Constitution is clear—the president can protect the Constitution only by abiding by it. The president cannot refuse to abide by the Constitution on the pretext of protecting it. The president not abiding by the Constitution is dereliction of duty.   
Let us be clear, anybody inciting the president to cross the limits of Constitution is inciting for dereliction of duty.
Article 66 further clarifies about the functions, duties and powers of president:
(1) The President shall exercise such powers and perform such duties as conferred on him or her in accordance with this Constitution or the federal law.
(2) In exercising the powers or duties under clause (1), the President shall perform all other functions to be performed by him or her on recommendation and with the consent of the Council of Ministers than those functions specifically provided to be performed on recommendation of any institution or official under this Constitution or federal law. Such recommendation and consent shall be submitted through the Prime Minister.
In this way, the president is clearly bound by the Constitution. The president performs functions on the recommendation of the Cabinet or on the recommendation of some other body or official clearly designated by the Constitution. The Constitution has not given the president the right to take a decision or execute any work regarding the country and government affairs on her own. The Constitution has also not given the president the right to take away the rights granted to others. Therefore, our president is a ceremonial president bound by the Constitution.
Despite such clear provisions regarding the president’s rights and duties, Bidya Devi Bhandari had assaulted the Constitution by not authenticating the bill. And the main opposition party UML had incited her for the assault. Several UML leaders including the chairman had defended the assault. Therefore they now don’t have the moral right to oppose President Paudel’s move.
Others can, however, oppose the president’s move and challenge it in court. The court’s interpretation will provide an outlet to this dispute too, and will set a precedent for the future. It is precedents like this that will continue to further refine and establish the Constitution.
For now, though, there’s a pleasant side to the president’s move: nearly 700,000 people have been deprived of citizenship even though they are children of Nepalis who became citizens by birth through a one-time arrangement after the Janaandolan II in 2006; they will now get citizenship immediately. They will get justice. Their lives will move ahead exercising their rights as Nepali citizens.

The main mantra for ending this scam is the clichéd ‘no guilty be spared, no innocent punished!’
Nepal Police Inspector General (IGP) Basanta Kunwar needs to be investigated as per the spirit of this mantra. He will be acquitted if innocent, and punished if guilty.
He is seen to be obstructing investigation on the fake Bhutanese refugees scam for a long time as per our analysis. The role he has played in the scam until now says so. We feel he has committed three unpardonable mistakes until now.
The first, a complaint on behalf of 81 victims was registered when he was chief of the Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office. They had claimed that the racket had collected Rs 130 million from them. They had submitted evidence of transferring money multiple times through the banking system. Members of the racket were arrested but were immediately released upon political pressure.
The second, contact of Kunwar with the members of the racket who were released after arrest is seen to have been established within a few days through the then home secretary Tek Narayan Pandey. So much so, that a member of the racket has even guaranteed financial support for him through Pandey.
The third, a member of the racket in his first statement after arrest accused former home minister and Nepali Congress (NC) leader Bal Krishna Khand of taking Rs 12.50 million from the racket. Recording of statement was stopped for 10 days after that. Khand sent an emissary to strike a deal with the racket members in police custody in those 10 days, and returned the bribe. Nobody took the name of Khand in the statements recorded duly after that.  
Who got this unpardonable crime committed? IGP Kunwar or chief of Kathmandu Police SSP Dan Bahadur Karki or chief of the Kathmandu Valley Police Office (Metro) AIG Shyam Gyawali? If it was committed by officers under Kunwar’s command, he should hold them accountable or be ready to answer himself.
IGP Kunwar needs to be investigated on these three issues and must face the questions raised. Setopati has sought appointment with IGP Kunwar for interview to ask these questions. He has not provided time until now. He is trying to evade these questions, but he cannot.
The questions will walk into the Singha Durbar if IGP Kunwar does not answer these questions, and will stop only after reaching the Home Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office because the buck always stops with the prime minister (PM) in a parliamentary democracy.  
Dear PM, dear home minister—did you stop the recording of statement for 10 days under pressure from coalition partners or for your own interest? Did the police make a mockery of the investigation process to save Khand on your instruction? If not, why have you not held IGP Kunwar accountable for that? Do you endorse the past maneuverings by IGP Kunwar to cover up the scam? Or do you believe that whatever IGP Kunwar has done in this scam until now was right? If yes, do defend him publicly, face all these questions and provide answers.   
IGP Kunwar may remain silent now. He can remain silent as long as you protect him. But you don’t have the choice of remaining silent. Either defend him or suspend him and initiate investigation.
Investigation on IGP Kunwar now is important for both immediate and long-term reasons.   
The immediate importance is due to the fact that investigation into the scam is yet to be completed. More complaints will be lodged, and are arriving. The curtain will be pulled back further in the scam, and more investigation will be necessary. IGP Kunwar will obstruct investigation as long as he remains at the Nepal Police Headquarters.
The role of police will be important not just in additional investigation, but also for creating an environment for impartial conclusion of the case being taken to the court now.
Several people are absconding even now. It is necessary to arrest them and produce them in court. Many witnesses who had testified to the police are absconding; they should also be produced. For example, racket member Sanu Bhandari’s elder brother Raju Bhandari has testified to the police that he had received Rs 3 million of the bribe that was returned. He will be a strong witness in court tomorrow. But he is currently out of contact.
Therefore Nepal Police needs a leadership that will move this investigation ahead in a strong and fair manner.
Its long-term significance is even greater.
Looking from a different perspective, IGP Kunwar’s guilt is less as he is only a product of this decadent system. Maybe he is indeed a good man. He could have been an amazing professional IGP.
But the corrupt and useless system that we have institutionalized in the name of democracy doesn’t want a professional IGP at all. Those in power want a servile IGP, an IGP who would obey their legitimate and illegitimate orders and who would be willing to cover up their sins and misdeeds when necessary.
Does Kunwar need to forsake his professional integrity and shield Congress leaders at any cost just because Bal Krishna Khand made him the top-ranked DIG and Congress made him IGP through its efforts?
In this sense, this useless system institutionalized by the political parties is more guilty than IGP Kunwar.
There is an outward appearance of democracy, but in essence this is such a system of bad governance that wants to install its own people in all key bodies of the state and expects them to play the role of servants. All key organs of the state – police, CIAA, court, Election Commission – have fallen prey to this bad governance.
Political parties and their present top leaders have a key role in institutionalizing and exploiting this system of bad governance in the guise of democracy.
This is what has been holding the Nepali society back now and raising people’s discontent to boiling point. And that is the thing that needs to be changed.
Leaders repeatedly say that things cannot continue as in the past, that they must correct and transform themselves.
It is now time to show whether they are merely speaking or will also change. It is time to become accountable and establish accountability in the main organs of the state.
It is time for departure from the practice of installing one’s men in the main organs of the state and using them as servants to cover up one’s mistakes.
Will you restrain the people, albeit a little, by embracing the different path of accountability from this episode, and instill some hope that things will change, or make them take to the streets with no hope of change?

Prime Minister (PM) Pushpa Kamal Dahal on March 20 decided to provide Rs 200,000 each to the then disqualified Maoist combatants when his party CPN (Maoist Center) was almost alone in the Cabinet and he was overseeing 16 ministries.
We wrote an editorial two days later explaining why the decision was wrong. We were clear then and even today that those who Dahal is trying to pay with the hard-earned money of taxpayers were not combatants.
The Maoists and other ruling parties have not been able to prove that those who are going to be paid are former combatants. They have not been able to show that the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) or any other past agreement had said that they should be paid. Nobody from the ruling parties has been able to come forward to defend this decision to dole out money.
We still challenge Maoist Center and the government--If they are men who had fought during the armed conflict and the peace accord or any other past agreement had said that they should be paid, show evidence. Or else stop this plunder of the taxpayers' money, and high-handednes.
Accountability for doling out taxpayers’ money to the Maoist cadres now will not only be sought from Maoist Center but even Nepali Congress (NC) that is the largest party in the ruling coalition and heads the Finance Ministry.
There are reports that the government has prepared a working procedure for providing Rs 200,000 each to the then disqualified Maoist combatants and the Finance Ministry has allocated budget for the purpose.
NC Chief Whip Ramesh Lekhak after the meeting of ruling coalition on March 22 had publicly stated that PM Dahal claimed in the meeting that decision to pay former Maoist combatants had not been taken.   
Why is the government now trying to legally dole out money by preparing a working procedure if PM Dahal had said so? NC and other coalition partners must seek answer for that from PM Dahal. If Dahal had not said so, a responsible NC leader can be deemed to have publicly lied to mislead the people.   
Whether PM Dahal had said so or not can be determined later. But those who were not even combatants should not be paid with taxpayers’ money on any pretext. This should be stopped. If the government does not stop it, somebody should move the court to stop it.
Let’s look at the Maoist claims that they are former combatants.
They claim that these 4,000 persons are combatants who had participated in the Maoist armed conflict. They should also have received financial relief as per the spirit of the peace deal. But they were not provided relief by labeling them ‘disqualified’ on different pretexts and suffered injustice. They were neither allowed to be integrated with the Nepal Army nor were paid by the state. It is, therefore, necessary to pay them even 15 years after signing of the peace deal as per the spirit of the deal.  
It is necessary to understand the peace process and the process of integrating Maoist combatants to know why these 4,000 persons who the Maoists want to pay with the taxpayers’ money are not former combatants and there was no agreement to pay them in this manner.
The seven political parties and the Maoists on November 8, 2006, had agreed to keep Maoist combatants in the main cantonments at Kailali, Surkhet, Rolpa, Palpa, Kavre, Sindhuli and Ilam districts, and that the combatants would be verified and monitored by the UN to hold peaceful and fair Constituent Assembly Election without any fear, and democratization and restructuring of the Nepal Army as per the spirit of the 12-point agreement, 8-point agreement, 25-point code of conduct, and the five-point letter sent to the UN on August 9, 2006.
The peace agreement signed on November 21, 2006 after that had agreed to keep the Maoist combatants and their weapons in the cantonments.
The agreement for monitoring of management of the weapons and combatants on December 6, 2006 then set standards for Maoist combatants. A person must have joined the Maoists before May 25, 2006, and be born before May 25, 1988 to qualify as a combatant during the verification process.
The cut-off date of birth was kept to be prior to May 25, 1988 to ensure that they would have completed at least 18 years on the cut-off date for joining the Maoist army.  An agreement, in other words, was reached that a minor younger than 18 years would not be recognized as a combatant. Using child soldiers in war is a crime even under international laws which deem those leading such wars to have committed a crime.
The Maoists sent a total of 32,350 persons to seven main cantonments and 21 sub-cantonments spread across the country saying they were combatants after the agreement for monitoring of management of the weapons and combatants on December 6, 2006.
The United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) then started the verification process to determine who out of them were combatants, and who were not. Most of them were not combatants and had left the cantonments even before verification.    
A total of 8,640 of those in the cantonments did not even turn up for the second stage of interview for verification of combatants.
UNMIN finally verified 19,602 of them to be combatants. Only 17,076 of them were present in the first stage of reclassification.
A total of 15,630 Maoist combatants then opted for voluntary retirement and returned home with Rs 500,000-800,000 while 1,422 were integrated in the Nepal Army. The 4,008 persons who UNMIN verified were not combatants left the cantonments without any payment. Because no agreement said that they would be paid after being found that they were not combatants.
How had they reached the cantonments then?
The number of combatants who had fought in the Maoist armed conflict was actually very low. A video of Maoist supremo Dahal talking about the numbers during a speech in the Shaktikhor cantonment had become public back then. Dahal had conceded in Shaktikhor that the Maoists actually had only around 7,000 combatants and taken pride in having been able to keep 30,000-35,000 persons in the cantonments fooling the state.   
The 4,008 expelled by UNMIN included their thousands of cadres and their children who were sent to the cantonments by the Maoists saying they would get relief package from the state.
Many of those 4,008 expelled by UNMIN saying they were not combatants had not completed 18 years until May 25, 2006. A total of 1,973 were below 18 years while 1,035 others could not prove that they had joined the Maoist army before the cut-off date of May 25, 2006 for joining the Maoist army even though they had completed 18.
UNMIN did not even investigate whether the 1,973 minors had joined the Maoist army or not. It first investigated age, and said that those who were underage were not eligible to become combatants without checking when they had been recruited.
It was difficult to go there even for UNMIN because verifying that child soldiers were recruited by the Maoists would have meant that the Maoist leadership had committed the crime of using child soldiers. That would have attracted international laws. UNMIN, therefore, did not venture there, and the Maoist leadership was freed from the accusation of using child soldiers for then.
If the Maoist leadership now insists that they were indeed combatants and participated in the armed conflict and hence should be compensated, that would establish that the Maoists had used child soldiers in the conflict. Is the Maoist leadership ready to face the consequences of accepting to have used child soldiers in the conflict?
UNMIN had not strictly investigated even the adult combatants then. Those who could answer a few simple questions were verified to be combatants. Over 19,000 were, therefore, verified to be combatants even though Dahal had conceded in the Shaktikhor video that the Maoists actually had only around 7,000 combatants. The state spent around Rs 20 billion in their management and integration. There was embezzlement of billions in the name of running the Maoist cantonments. The advance of Rs 460 million taken by Maoist leader Krishna Bahadur Mahara for the combatants at cantonments was never reimbursed.
Everyone turned a blind eye to that to establish peace in the country and bring the Maoists into the mainstream. How necessary that was would perhaps be evaluated by history.
But the way the Maoists have continued their efforts to dole out taxpayers’ money to their cadres even after joining mainstream politics and 16 years after the peace deal is condemnable.
This is not the first time that attempts have ben made to give those 4,000 persons Rs 200,000 each. The Maoists had first made the attempt in 2012 when its leader Baburam Bhattarai was PM. It was made again when there was a coalition government including CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) in 2016.
Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel in the then KP Sharma Oli government had allocated Rs 840 million to pay Rs 200,000 each to the disqualified combatants and to those who had opted for voluntary retirement but had not received the lump sum in the budget for the fiscal year 2073/74.
That distribution was stopped when a few NC cadres and conflict victims moved the Supreme Court (SC) against the decision.
Dahal has now become PM for the third time. It has already been 15 years since he first became PM. It may not have been unnatural for him to have more rebellious attitude and less responsibility toward the state. But the determination showed by Dahal to try to pay his cadres from the state coffers when he has become PM for the third time is irresponsible. It shows that he has failed to understand the sensitivity of current times and his responsibility toward the general public.
The country is currently in a difficult economic situation. Not only Nepal, the whole world is affected by recession. In South Asia, all countries except India are going through a difficult economic situation. Those countries, including Nepal, have taken assistance from the International Monetary Fund to sustain the economy.
The recession has also affected the market and the general public. Many businesses have not been able to pay salaries on time. Many have furloughed their staff. The businesses themselves are in a tight spot as they are not able to pay the bank’s interest. Then there’s the mental stress of those with fixed income who have to pay installments to banks. The government has not been able to collect revenues due to the recession. If the situation worsens further, a situation could arise where it would be difficult to provide salaries to employees and to service debts.
How can the act of PM, who should be leading the job of extricating the country from this economic challenge, doling out nearly a billion rupees from the state coffers to his cadres in the name of combatants be justified at such a time? The patience of general public toward the government is already wearing thin.
We, therefore, politely advise those in the government to never do something that they cannot publicly defend and justify. The dissatisfaction of people 2can explode any time if you try to further test their patience, and that will not spare anyone.

The establishment of public enterprises dates back to the early 19th century during the Industrial Revolution. During that time, in some countries private companies had monopolized critical industries, leading to high prices, and goods and services of poor quality. Whereas in some developing countries like Nepal, there was a lack of infrastructure, not many industries, and less investment capacity of the private sector.  So, like the rest of the world, Nepal too wholeheartedly welcomed public enterprises with the establishment of Biratnagar Jute Mill in 1950. 
Over the past decade, public enterprises (PE) all over the world have faced numerous economic, financial, and political crises. Some of the main reasons being government interference, mismanagement, and corruption. Political interference can lead to decisions that prioritize political goals over economic efficiency and effectiveness, which can cause financial losses and operational inefficiencies. Public enterprises around the world such as Air India, Petrobras, a state-owned oil company in Brazil, Indian Railways, British Leyland, etc started facing numerous financial crises,  leading to multiple bailouts by the respective governments. A similar path was followed by public enterprises in Nepal where public enterprises were a burden on taxpayers. 
The fall of state-led planning and the adoption of market-based systems which started in the mid-20th century was driven by economic stagnation, high inflation, and mounting debt. The shift toward market-based approaches was particularly pronounced in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, where the collapse of communism led to privatization and market-oriented reforms. The belief that market-based approaches are more efficient, flexible, and responsive to changing economic conditions than state-led planning drove this change. Nepal too was a part of the wave and the restoration of multi-party system in Nepal in 1990 marked a significant turning point in the country's political and economic history as the new democratic government in Nepal recognized this problem. Privatization and liberalization became key strategies for eradicating these problems. The government then enacted the Privatization Act 1994 which provides answers to all the arguments dwelling around privatization. Major reasons to enact the Privatization Act 1994 were, the falling productivity of the enterprises, the inability of the government to bear any additional financial burden, and the promotion of the private sector to boost the economy. The government, however, has displayed a reluctance to fully embrace the important tenets of the reforms that were deemed crucial at the time, which can be perceived as a double standard approach. Notably, there have been instances of the government introducing private-public partnership arrangements, which have failed to fully privatize public companies.
Despite the degrading performance of public companies starting from 1994 Nepal has been according high priority to public enterprises ever since the Second Plan of the National Planning Commission (NPC). They are considered the “Vehicle for Development”. There are 44 total public enterprises in Nepal among which  22 are profit-making, 19 are loss-making and  three are closed. More importantly, according to the fiscal year 2020/2021, even for profit-making public enterprises, their profits are going down significantly by 40.3%, of those loss-making public enterprises, their losses continue to rise by 3.6% and administrative expenses tend to go up in all of them. Regardless, in the fiscal year, 2022/2023 government spent a total of Rs. 96.7 billion budget on public enterprises including Rs. 62.3 billion as foreign assistance. On top of that, the government gave an additional subsidy of Rs. 8.1 billion in the same year. They were envisaged as an instrument for production and the execution of socioeconomic policies in the country. The budget speech for the fiscal year 2022/2023 states “The Janakpur Cigarette Factory, Agricultural Tools Factory, Gorakhkali Rubber Industry, Orient and Magnesite, Nepal Metal Company, Biratnagar Jute Mill, Birgunj Sugar Mill, Hetauda Textile Industry and Butwal Spinning Mills, will be brought into operation in a systematic way.” The promises made by government ministers regarding the revival of public enterprises are often unfounded and lack a solid strategy for achieving long-term success. We will further discuss why running public enterprises are ineffective in Nepal and should be privatized immediately. 
Stakeholders as Risk Averters
To successfully run a business, the management must possess a significant risk-taking capacity. However, this is a quality that public sector entities often lack due to their prioritization of procedures over outcomes. In these sectors, stakeholders are primarily concerned with safeguarding their reputations, as any deviation from established protocols can result in scrutiny from anti-graft bodies such as the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA). This can be illustrated by the preference for private sector banks over government-run banks when seeking loans, as private banks offer greater flexibility in considering factors such as start-up ideas or company stocks, whereas government banks are limited to collateral as the sole determinant of loan eligibility. In light of the potential consequences for stakeholders who take risks beyond established protocols, it is understandable that they tend to incline on the side of caution.
Non-Value Adding Protocols
Similarly, having to follow protocols that do not add any value also stretches the decision-making process in the public sector as it often results in a huge opportunity cost. One example would be the comparison between Maruti Cement and Udaipur Cement. Both companies are situated in the same location with the same proximity to resources and the neighboring country India. Even the ores of both the companies are same in Sindhali, but despite that in the fiscal year 2020/2021 Maruti Cement incurred a profit of Rs 5.631 billion whereas Udaipur Cement incurred a loss of Rs 3.3 bn. This is because when these companies need to buy machinery for their operation Maruti Cement can instantly purchase from its supplier at the best price and deal, whereas for Udaipur Cement its procedure requires it to open a long tender process costing the company millions of opportunity cost. Although the bidding process is usually fair, tenders often do not fall below a certain amount set by the government, leaving the company with less bargaining power. Apart from this where Maruti Cement has to transport its raw materials in trucks which is a relatively expensive medium for transportation, Udaipur Cement is leveraged with its own 13.8-km cable ropeway to transport limestone from Sindhali-hill to the factory cutting its cost significantly. Despite this advantage, Udaipur Cement's loss indicates its inability to compete effectively, highlighting the need for the company to be privatized.
Lack of Accountability
Likewise, the issue of lack of accountability within public enterprises in Nepal is a well-documented problem that has contributed to their poor performance and financial losses as the government bails out the public enterprises regardless of the outcome leaving the stakeholders with no incentive to maximize the profit. Four months after the Royal Nepal Airlines made the biggest purchase in Nepali aviation history, acquiring two Airbus A330-200s for Rs. 2.75 billion the corporation said that it was on the verge of bankruptcy, and asked for a bailout of Rs 20 billion, declaring itself crisis-ridden which was provided by the government as subsidy. Additionally, the stakeholders of the public enterprises are designated on the basis of monthly payroll. Hence regardless of the loss made by their company they are entitled to their share of the salary and are entitled to an appraisal every five years regardless of their performance again leaving them with no incentive to maximize the profit.
Political Interference
Furthermore, political interference is another factor contributing to the inefficiency of public enterprises in Nepal. The government often appoints unqualified or under-qualified individuals to top positions in public enterprises based on political connections rather than merit, resulting in poor decision-making, lack of accountability, and a culture of corruption within public enterprises. One example is the case of Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC) where in 2018, a parliamentary committee found that the NOC had incurred a loss of Rs 1.7 billion due to irregularities in the procurement of petroleum products. The committee's report stated that political interference was the primary cause of the irregularities, as senior officials in the NOC were appointed based on political connections. The report also stated that the NOC had paid Rs 650 million to a private company without conducting a proper tender process, which was again attributed to political interference. It was also revealed that the NOC had paid up to Rs 1.3 million per kattha of land on the banks of the Rohani River in Bhairahawa while the actual value of the land was less than Rs 500,000.
Then Why this Affinity Toward Public Enterprise?
Despite this, people often fail to understand that the loss incurred by public enterprises is a loss incurred by the general public. Additionally, there is often socialist propaganda against privatization, especially in developing countries, perpetuated by interest groups and politicians who argue that private companies are solely motivated by profit, which only benefits the rich and evades taxes. However, these accusations are often baseless as private companies do contribute to the country's economy through taxes. While it is true that some private companies evade taxes, it is unfair to blame privatization as a concept rather than the individuals responsible for that. Moreover, the issue of tax evasion often involves collusion between government employees and the private sector. This problem can be addressed if the government body is strong and accountable. This propaganda can also be explained by an economic term called “The Public Choice Theory” which suggests that politicians are self-interested and motivated by their own goals, including gaining votes and maintaining their power. In the case of public companies in Nepal, politicians often prioritize them and splurge huge budgets on them, even though they may incur significant losses. This can be attributed to the fact that public companies provide opportunities for politicians to gain support and votes from a major voting pool, which includes employees of these companies, their families, and their communities. By investing in public companies, politicians can gain the loyalty and support of these groups, which can translate into votes during elections. Furthermore, politicians often use public companies as a means of redistributing wealth and resources, particularly to their constituencies, thereby consolidating their power and influence. However, this focus on public companies often leads to inefficient resource allocation, as resources are directed toward companies that may not be financially viable, rather than toward more productive uses. This can result in significant losses for these companies and ultimately affect the overall economic performance of the country.
Undeniably, there may be situations where private companies are not financially viable or efficient. Ultimately, the question of who is most capable of successfully running business operations within a country must be considered, and it is clear that in case of Nepal, the government is not the most adept entity for this task. Over the years, public enterprises have faced challenges such as inefficiency, corruption, and mismanagement, leading to financial losses and a decline in service quality. The government's reluctance to fully embrace privatization and liberalization has made the situation worse, as public enterprises are now unsustainable and a burden on taxpayers. The poor performance of public enterprises each year indicates the need for immediate privatization. On the brighter side, the government on April 22 formed a Public Institutions Suggestion Committee after billions of investments made in public enterprises failed to yield any returns. The committee needs to consider all the above aspects and fully embrace privatization to contain any more avoidable burden to the economy which is already in a critical state.

Kathmandu Mayor Balen Shah has issued instruction to not pick garbage from the Singha Durbar and the Shital Niwas from Saturday. Waste materials are starting to pile up at the country’s administrative center and other sensitive areas of the state after his instruction to Paribartan Nepal, a private company that has been collecting garbage.  
“Garbage of Singha Durbar will not be picked from today. Leaders there will have to be dumped at Sisdole if the country really has to be cleaned,” Shah had posted on Facebook Saturday to inform about stopping garbage collection.
Both the expression and the deed of Shah are irresponsible and anarchic.
Those in public position should not just fulfill their responsibilities but also maintain decorum of their post. They should also think about dignity of others. What does he actually mean by ‘leaders from Singha Durbar will have to be dumped at Sisdole if the country really has to be cleaned’? This is absolutely anarchic and apolitical expression in itself. This says more about Shah himself than other leaders.
Leaders, whether seated at the Singha Durbar or the Bag Durbar, have both strengths and weaknesses. People have elected them to their respective posts expecting them to resolve the country’s problems remaining within their limits and maintaining dignity.
Shah seems to suffer from this mental illness that only he is right and all the others deserve to be dumped at Sisdole. He can criticize the works of others and also recommend to work in a certain manner. He can offer support but cannot run away from his responsibilities by abusing and blaming others.
He posted a defense of his decision to not pick garbage from the Singha Durbar on Monday listing the works in which 14 ministries of the federal government did not cooperate with him. The majority of the issues he has raised are beyond his jurisdiction. He has stake in them in capacity of a citizen and a mayor, and can also speak about them or provide suggestion. But he cannot stop picking of garbage from the Prime Minister’s Office and the President’s Office citing lack of cooperation by others in issues not in his jurisdiction.  
Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) not picking garbage from the Prime Minister’s Office and the President’s Office is as unimaginable and irresponsible as the federal government stopping budget allocated for the KMC or not sending staffers citing lack of support from mayor.
Let us look at some of the issues he says that the federal government has not cooperated on. He has said that he met different ministers once or twice and talked about issues ranging from the program of bringing Melamchi water round the year to Kathmandu by connecting Yangri and Larke rivers to Melamchi to management of Melamchi water and pipeline, appropriate management of the Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited (KUKL), procurement of fertilizers for the farmers, cooperative regulations and laws, expansion of the Ring Road, sanitation of public hospitals, insurance, implementation of the Supreme Court (SC) order to demolish the top story of the Health Ministry, and even passing the map of airport.
He has stated that he reached the conclusion to not pick garbage from the Singha Durbar as the problems have not been resolved and there was no appropriate coordination despite his efforts for nine months.
Some of the issues and works he has raised may be of concern for him but definitely not in his jurisdiction. Those problems will not be resolved merely after him meeting the ministers and talking with them. The line ministries and government bodies work in their own manner and there may be dalliance and lack of appropriate coordination in some of those works. There may even be corruption in some of those works. But that all comes down to the capacity of our overall state system. That is precisely why we are in the current state.
If a mere meeting of the mayor with the ministers were to resolve those problems, they would not have remained unresolved until now in the first place. There is an error in the thinking that problems remain only because nobody wants them resolved. To think all seated at the Singha Durbar are crooks and say that they deserve to be dumped at Sisdole is his hubris and madness. 
Why many problems that the KMC can resolve on its own remain as they were if the problems facing the country could be resolved magically as he seems to think or if mere good intentions were to suffice? Has the KMC completed all the works that it can do on its own?
The KMC has not been able to resolve many problems that many other metropolitan cities have resolved.
Let us look at a small example. There is problem of squatters in almost all the metropolitan cities of the country. There are genuine and fake squatters in all metropolitan cities. It is necessary to first ascertain who out of them are genuine squatters and who are not to resolve the problem. Record must be collected by going to the squatter settlements for that. It is the responsibility of the metropolitan cities to do that. The state has formulated a policy to address those identified as genuine squatters in that manner. The state accepts that it has responsibility toward them. It is basic responsibility of the state even from the perspective of social justice. Many metropolitan cities have moved forward toward resolving the problem after collecting record of squatters but the KMC is not ready to collect record of squatters. It contends that all of them are encroachers and their record, therefore, should not be collected. Shah stresses on removing them even at the cost of a bloody clash deploying excavators and the police. He has made many attempts to that regard. The KMC has been forced to take a step back after clash with the squatters on each occasion.
His main gripe with the Singha Durbar is lack of mobilization of police to exercise force on the squatters. A civilized state that believes in social justice never can, and should, support him in this wrong objective.  
Mayor Balen Shah suffers from this attitude that all he thinks and believes in is right, and all others think and believe in is wrong, and only he is right and all others are wrong. His prescription of dumping all others at Sisdole to develop the country is manifestation of that attitude.
KMC is not just Balen Shah. It also has other elected representatives. He seems to have unilaterally taken the decision to not pick garbage from the Singha Durbar and the Shital Niwas without consulting anyone.  Deputy mayor and the ward chair concerned have confirmed that the mayor’s decision was made without informing them. The other elected people’s representatives of KMC also cannot evade this issue now. They must speak clearly whether what he has done is right or wrong. They must form a position as to whether to do so in the pretext of cooperation from the federal government is right or not.
Let us assume that the Prime Minister’s Office and the ministries actually did not cooperate. Why drag the office of the constitutional president in this? How is the office of the head of state connected to this? Why was the prestige of that office not considered even a bit?
 Let the other elected representatives of KMC and the federal government speak clearly to Mayor Shah. Let the federal government immediately provide support and coordination it can in the works of KMC. Not just the KMC but even other local bodies and provincial government have been facing obstruction in their works in lack of necessary laws and downward delegation of the rights. Let the federal government work for resolving that as soon as possible.
Let everyone remind Mayor Balen Shah of his limits, the dignity and responsibilities of mayoralty; tell him that federal, provincial and local governments must move forward with mutual support, coordination and cooperation; and remind him that problems cannot be resolved by blaming and abusing one another.

Who are the 4,000 or so persons that CPN (Maoist Center) wants to pay Rs 200,000 each to from the state coffers?
The Maoists claim that these 4,000 persons are combatants who participated in the armed conflict. They were due financial package as per the spirit of the peace agreement. But they were not provided the package by labeling them disqualified on different pretexts and they suffered injustice. They could neither be integrated in the Nepal Army (NA) nor were paid by the state. It is, therefore, necessary to pay them even 15 years after the peace agreement as per the spirit of the peace process.
The Cabinet meeting on March 20 decided to provide Rs 200,000 each to them and has sent the decision to the Home Ministry. Home Secretary Binod Prakash Singh has told the Rastriya Samachar Samiti that the ministry is preparing a working procedure for distributing the money.
Some of the Nepali Congress (NC) leaders say that they have been told by Prime Minister (PM) Pushpa Kamal Dahal that such a decision has not been taken. PM Dahal himself, however, has not spoken publicly about the issue. It can, therefore, be understood that the process of distributing relief has moved forward.
Are the 4,000 persons that the Maoists want to pay with the taxpayers’ money really combatants? We have to look at the background of the peace process to understand that.
The seven political parties and the Maoists on November 8, 2006 had agreed to keep Maoist combatants in the main cantonments at Kailali, Surkhet, Rolpa, Palpa, Kavre, Sindhuli and Ilam districts, and that the combatants would be verified and monitored by the UN to hold peaceful and fair Constituent Assembly Election without any fear, and democratization and restructuring of the Nepal Army as per the spirit of the 12-point agreement, 8-point agreement, 25-point code of conduct, and the five-point letter sent to the UN on August 9, 2006.
The peace agreement signed on November 21, 2006 after that had agreed to keep the Maoist combatants and their weapons in the cantonments.
The agreement for monitoring of management of the weapons and combatants on December 6, 2006 then set standards for Maoist combatants. A person must have joined the Maoists before May 25, 2006, and be born before May 25, 1988 to qualify as a combatant during the verification process.
The cut-off date of birth was kept to be prior to May 25, 1988 to ensure that they would have completed at least 18 years on the cut-off date for joining the Maoist army.  An agreement, in other words, was reached that a minor younger than 18 years would not be recognized as a combatant. Using child soldiers in war is a crime even under international laws which deem those leading such wars to have committed a crime.
The Maoists sent a total of 32,350 persons to seven main cantonments and 21 sub-cantonments spread across the country saying they were combatants after the agreement for monitoring of management of the weapons and combatants on December 6, 2006.
The United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) then started the verification process to determine who out of them were combatants, and who were not. Most of them were not combatants and had left the cantonments even before verification.    
A total of 8,640 of those in the cantonments did not even turn up for the second stage of interview for verification of combatants.
UNMIN finally verified 19,602 of them to be combatants. Only 17,076 of them were present in the first stage of reclassification.
A total of 15,630 Maoist combatants then opted for voluntary retirement and returned home with Rs 500,000-800,000 while 1,422 were integrated in the Nepal Army. The 4,008 persons who UNMIN verified were not combatants left the cantonments without any payment. Because no agreement said that they would be paid after being found that they were not combatants.
How had they reached the cantonments then?
The number of combatants who had fought in the Maoist armed conflict was actually very low. A video of Maoist supremo Dahal talking about the numbers during a speech in the Shaktikhor cantonment had become public back then. Dahal had conceded in Shaktikhor that the Maoists actually had only around 7,000 combatants and taken pride in having been able to keep 30,000-35,000 persons in the cantonments fooling the state.   
The 4,008 expelled by UNMIN included their thousands of cadres and their children who were sent to the cantonments by the Maoists saying they would get relief package from the state.
Many of those 4,008 expelled by UNMIN saying they were not combatants had not completed 18 years until May 25, 2006. A total of 1,973 were below 18 years while 1,035 others could not prove that they had joined the Maoist army before the cut-off date of May 25, 2006 for joining the Maoist army even though they had completed 18.
UNMIN did not even investigate whether the 1,973 minors had joined the Maoist army or not. It first investigated age, and said that those who were underage were not eligible to become combatants without checking when they had been recruited.
It was difficult to go there even for UNMIN because verifying that child soldiers were recruited by the Maoists would have meant that the Maoist leadership had committed the crime of using child soldiers. That would have attracted international laws. UNMIN, therefore, did not venture there, and the Maoist leadership was freed from the accusation of using child soldiers for then.
If the Maoist leadership now insists that they were indeed combatants and participated in the armed conflict and hence should be compensated, that would establish that the Maoists had used child soldiers in the conflict. Is the Maoist leadership ready to face the consequences of accepting to have used child soldiers in the conflict?
UNMIN had not strictly investigated even the adult combatants then. Those who could answer a few simple questions were verified to be combatants. Over 19,000 were, therefore, verified to be combatants even though Dahal had conceded in the Shaktikhor video that the Maoists actually had only around 7,000 combatants. The state spent around Rs 20 billion in their management and integration. There was embezzlement of billions in the name of running the Maoist cantonments. The advance of Rs 460 million taken by Maoist leader Krishna Bahadur Mahara for the combatants at cantonments was never reimbursed.
Everyone turned a blind eye to that to establish peace in the country and bring the Maoists into the mainstream. How necessary that was would perhaps be evaluated by history.
But the way the Maoists have continued their efforts to dole out taxpayers’ money to their cadres even after joining mainstream politics and 16 years after the peace deal is condemnable.
This is not the first time that attempts have ben made to give those 4,000 persons Rs 200,000 each. The Maoists had first made the attempt in 2012 when its leader Baburam Bhattarai was PM. It was made again when there was a coalition government including CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) in 2016.
Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel in the then KP Sharma Oli government had allocated Rs 840 million to pay Rs 200,000 each to the disqualified combatants and to those who had opted for voluntary retirement but had not received the lump sum in the budget for the fiscal year 2073/74.
That distribution was stopped when a few NC cadres and conflict victims moved the Supreme Court (SC) against the decision.
Dahal has now become PM for the third time. It has already been 15 years since he first became PM. It may not have been unnatural for him to have more rebellious attitude and less responsibility toward the state. But the determination showed by Dahal to try to pay his cadres from the state coffers when he has become PM for the third time is irresponsible. It shows that he has failed to understand the sensitivity of current times and his responsibility toward the general public.
The country is currently in a difficult economic situation. Not only Nepal, the whole world is affected by recession. In South Asia, all countries except India are going through a difficult economic situation. Those countries, including Nepal, have taken assistance from the International Monetary Fund to sustain the economy.
The recession has also affected the market and the general public. Many businesses have not been able to pay salaries on time. Many have furloughed their staff. The businesses themselves are in a tight spot as they are not able to pay the bank’s interest. Then there’s the mental stress of those with fixed income who have to pay installments to banks. The government has not been able to collect revenues due to the recession. If the situation worsens further, a situation could arise where it would be difficult to provide salaries to employees and to service debts.
What message will it send to the general public when the PM wants to dole out nearly a billion rupees from the state coffers to his cadres in the name of combatants at a time when he should be leading the job of extricating the country from this economic challenge?
What do coalition partner NC and NC leaders who are ironing their daura-suruwals to join the government say about it? On what basis will NC, which was against it when it was in the opposition in the past, support it now? Maybe it will now be opposed by UML, which had tried to provide Rs 200,000 each to these 4,000 people to appease the Maoists by including it in the budget itself. Trust in parties has deteriorated almost to a point of no return because of this double standard.
Let’s call a spade a spade, whether in the government or in the opposition.
The Maoists won’t be able to justify in any way the rationale behind their plan to distribute the tax money collected from the public’s hard work to their cadres. There has been no agreement in the past to provide money from the state coffers to those who were not combatants. The Maoists should put a stop to such attempts at recklessly imposing a burden on the state coffers and splurging on its cadres in the name of peace agreement.

Parliamentary system, they say, gives two governments to the voters at one go: one is the government that takes over the reins of power and the other the government-in-waiting.
The government that takes over power performs in accordance with the commitments made to the people. The parliamentary system expects that the government works for the people and their benefits.
But the parties that assume powers do not necessarily always abide by these democratic ideals. They often don't do so going by our own experience. The government has its own interests and compulsions, and the leaders of the parties also have their own agendas and interests. They often put their own agendas above the interests of the people and the country. The government prevails over the people and their fundamental rights at such times, and tries to curtail the people's rights to serve its own interests.
The voters in parliamentary democracy, therefore, also elect the main opposition party or the government-in-waiting to stop such despotic whims of the government. Parliamentary system is such a system of balance that puts the strongest party or coalition in power, and the next strongest party in the opposition so that the despotic whims of the government are challenged; it can strongly stand in the House for the people's rights and their daily lives, and compliance of the Constitution and laws to stop those in power from abusing the Constitution and the laws.  
The ruling party also fears the opposition party, aware that it is the government-in-waiting. The ruling party is always alert about the possibility of the people bringing it down from power and putting the main opposition party in power in the next election.
Nepali Congress (NC), which calls itself the defender of parliamentary democracy, has demolished this beautiful balance of power inherent in the parliamentary system.
NC President and Parliamentary Party Leader Sher Bahadur Deuba has shirked the immense role and responsibilities of the main opposition party to participate in the unholy wagering for power. Setopati reminds him that the politicians that run away from the august role of the main opposition leader also do not have any moral grounds to take over the reins of power tomorrow.
Having contested the election forging an electoral alliance with the promise of forming the government from the same coalition, Deuba failed to give the government promised to the people. His greed for power was mainly to blame for the unraveling of that coalition after he broke his promise to make CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal prime minister (PM) first and tried to become PM instead, thereby forcing Dahal to take refuge at Balkot. Deuba has again started to wager for power after a new ruling coalition was formed comprising CPN-UML, Maoist Center and five other parties.
Deuba and those close to him seem to have hoped for Maoist support during the presidential election for now, and aspired for eventually breaking the current coalition in the long run. The way in which NC leader Ram Chandra Paudel has openly defended the decision to give vote of confidence to Dahal hints as much. The way Paudel has been abandoning his ideals for personal interests in recent times is appalling.
Dahal also seems to want to have the cake and eat it too by acquiring support from the two parties larger than his. He reached Deuba's new residence at Dhumbarahi after going to KP Sharma Oli's at Balkot as per that strategy.
It is not hard to see through Dahal's strategy of keeping his post safe scaring Oli by showing Deuba and vice versa. The course of this strategy, however, will end after the presidential election. He must choose one out of NC and UML in the presidential election.    
NC has deviated from the spirit of the parliamentary system of either forming the government or playing a strong role of opposition respecting the people's mandate at a time when the system has come under vehement attack, and the limits and dignity of democracy have been increasingly crossed by everyone.
Our Constitution has not authorized the PM to dissolve the House as long as the final alternative to give the government remains. But Oli twice dissolved the House crossing the limits of the Constitution that he himself prepared with wanton abandon, and the Supreme Court rightly reinstated the House deeming the dissolution unconstitutional on both the occasions.
But Oli shamelessly tried to defend his unconstitutional step of dissolving the House from the rostrum of the very sovereign House on Monday and Tuesday.
On the other hand, President Bidya Devi Bhandari has repeatedly put herself above the Constitution and Parliament. The Constitution has not given her the right to obstruct any work of the Cabinet or defy its decisions. But Bhandari has been sitting on two ordinances passed by the Cabinet. By refusing to authenticate a bill passed by Parliament, she has behaved in a manner to suggest she is above the sovereign Parliament elected by the people.
Oli, who himself flouted the Constitution, and his party have publicly defended the president’s actions. UML has lost the moral right to protest if a president elected with the support of another party were to disobey the decisions of a government under its leadership tomorrow.
The moral turpitude seen in parties who are major proponents of this system and Constitution during such attacks on the Constitution and the system has become a matter of great concern.
Parliamentary system becomes strong only when its major stakeholders agree to stay within its boundaries regardless of whether they are in power or out of power, and when they remain devoted to protecting the essence of the system. Those who are the first to violate the Constitution and break the system at the slightest opportunity are the biggest threat to parliamentary system and this Constitution. Unfortunately, Congress has also joined their ranks today.
Nepali Congress is constantly becoming weaker, both morally and in terms of public support, during the period with the ever power-hungry Deuba as its president.
In the 2017 general election Nepali Congress became the second-largest party in terms of popular votes for the first time in Nepal’s political history. President Deuba defended himself saying UML finished ahead of them on popular votes because of the left alliance even though the popular votes of Nepali Congress had increased.
There was no left alliance in this year’s election. UML had split. CPN (Unified Socialist), which had splintered from UML, received nearly 300,000 votes. But UML still became the largest party in terms of popular votes, finishing ahead of Congress by more than 150,000 votes.
NC has been losing the grounds to form a government on its own in recent times due to gradual erosion of its political base. The grand old party looks doomed to losing even the status of main opposition party looking at the people's revulsion toward the NC leadership and its recent misdeeds.
The lawmakers in the party who have yet to lose conscience must, therefore, seriously review the role of NC. They should play the role of a strong opposition in the House relinquishing the rat race for power in the current difficult situation for the parliamentary system if they have even an iota of historical responsibilities of the party. Play that role for safeguarding the people's rights and their interests, at least conserve a party to pin the people's hopes on if they lose trust in the parties in power to ensure that they don't give up on the parliamentary system.

The people have already elected 165 House of Representatives (HoR) members directly while the process of electing another 110 members through the Proportional Representation (PR) electoral system is in the final stage. A total of 275 elected lawmakers will enter the HoR in a few weeks to formulate laws for the country through periodic election.
The main tenet of democracy is the people legislating for themselves exercising that sovereign right through their representatives.
The elected people's representatives form the government to work for the people and formulate laws to bind that government and the general public. Nobody is above those laws and there is rule of law in the country. The biggest importance and spirit of modern democracy is vested in that.
The gerontocratic leaders of old parties with longevity like that of the sun and the moon who cannot see anything but power and do not care about any norms and limits of democracy have been repeatedly attacking this spirit. This has happened once again.
But the issue is graver than those of yesterday because a new government is going to be formed after the previous mandate expired. New lawmakers have been elected as people's representatives. The government formed as per the previous mandate and already past expiry date has amended an important criminal law through an ordinance with utter disregard for them. The law of the land does not allow the government to withdraw cases of grave crimes sub judice in the court. The court has repeatedly cautioned the government through its orders and verdicts in that regard.
The place to discuss and debate about the matter if someone in special circumstances is hard done by the prevailing laws and court precedents, and to amend them is the House elected by the people. The ordinance brought by the government now, therefore, is not right in the crucible of time, people's mandate, Constitution, laws or political morality. The government should, therefore, take back this ordinance.
There are many dimensions to the issue of 'bringing this ordinance for justice to' Resham Chaudhary, who has been jailed for almost five years, and other political rebels.
First things first, this ordinance has not been brought to ensure justice for Chaudhary. The government could have taken the bill related to the issue to the previous HoR if it genuinely felt that Chaudhary suffered injustice. This government has been in power for around one and a half years and had a clear majority in the previous House. The current ordinance has come as a bargaining tool for power. It has been brought to solicit Chaudhary's support in mustering a majority for the ruling coalition in the newly elected House. This quid pro quo will further complicate the issue of 'injustice' to Chaudhary, and will condemn him to further injustice.
Chaudhary is facing a court case as one of the main accused of the Tikapur incident in which eight police personnel including an SSP of Nepal Police and a toddler were lynched on August 24, 2015. He has been claiming that he was outside Tikapur on that day and he did not have anything to do with the attack on the police.
The then government had formed a judicial commission under former Supreme Court (SC) justice Girish Chandra Lal to find facts about the incident after thorough investigation. And that commission submitted its report almost five years back. The government has changed many times in the intervening period but the government has yet to make that report public.
Chaudhary's supporters claim that the report does not implicate Chaudhary in the Tikapur incident as the court case filed by the government contends, and many feel that he has been unjustly implicated and jailed. The government has supported these claims by not making the report public.
A large chunk of the Tharu community genuinely feels that Chaudhary is suffering injustice due to the shady character of the major political parties that say one thing when they are in power and quite another while in the opposition. This grievance of the Tharu community has manifested in this election. Nagarik Unmukti Party, registered under the leadership of Chaudhary's wife Ranjeeta Shrestha, has won three HoR seats under the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) electoral system while the party's Lalbir Chaudhary has been elected as an independent candidate from Bardiya-2 after filing rebel candidacy. The party has won 12 seats in the provincial assembly and has secured almost 300,000 votes in the PR electoral system for HoR. This shows the sympathy of the Tharu community toward Resham Chaudhary and the degree of their displeasure toward the case filed against him.
The newly elected House cannot ignore the issue. It is the responsibility of the new House to study the Lal report, explore the additional aspects of the Tikapur incident, and prepare legal grounds and way toward justice for him if it concludes that he indeed has suffered injustice.
The new House can grant justice to Chaudhary in the true sense only by amending the law completing due procedures if he has suffered injustice, and acquit him of the allegations slapped against him. He will be deemed offender by a large chunk of the people if he is released through the ordinance as part of the quid pro quo for the government. That will be a bigger injustice to him. We, therefore, also urge him to not stress on the horse trading for government.
As far as the leaders of the ruling parties are concerned, they have been found repeatedly wanting on the issue of democratic processes and rule of law. Every leader of big parties has made a mockery of rule of law and abused the laws for vested interests while in the government. Ordinance, which is brought at the time of emergency or absence of House for essential works that must be done, has been turned into a tool of rulers for their vested interests.
There are rising aspirations of the people, especially the younger generation, that there is exercise of advanced democracy, rule of law, and democracy does not turn into an armor to cover up the caprices of those in power. The new generation has delivered that very message by establishing new parties in the recent HoR election.
The archaic leaders of the old parties have been repeatedly proving how alienated they are from these aspirations by bringing such ordinances. They will perhaps continue that until they are displaced.

The Election Commission has asked Setopati through an email to remove a news report published on Friday within 24 hours. We had published a news titled ‘Agni Kharel’s son Nishan in US Army, also continues to hold Nepali citizenship’ on Friday. The Election Commission on Saturday has asked for removal of the news report within 24 hours and sought explanation stating ‘There was character assassination of an individual who is candidate in the election and his family, and the news report has been published in a way that there is personal allegation’.
The letter issued by the Election Commission has yet to arrive in Setopati. We will decide whether to directly move the court to seek legal remedy or furnish explanation to the Election Commission once we receive the letter. We firmly believe that the Election Commission has instructed for removal of the news violating the limits and decorum of a constitutional commission on an issue it is not concerned with.
We have four major disagreements over the instruction by the Election Commission to remove the news and explanation it has sought.
First, the Election Commission has sought explanation on one hand while it has instructed to remove the news without waiting for that explanation on the other. This behavior of the Election Commission is ill-intentioned and unfortunate in itself.
The second is about its allegation that there was character assassination of an individual who is candidate in the election and his family, and the news report has been published in a way that there is personal allegation.
The news report published in Setopati mentions that Agni Kharel’s son Nishan Kharel serves in the US Army, and he still holds Nepali citizenship certificate and is included in the voter list. Both of those are facts. The Election Commission itself can check with its voter list. Our news report mentions that Agni Kharel himself has told Seopati that his son Nishan has been serving in the US Army for seven years.
We want to ask the Election Commission—how does this news report slander Agni Kharel who is candidate in the election, and his family? How is it an allegation?
The Election Commission instead has publicly slandered us by making such false allegations against Setopati. We challenge the Election Commission to prove this allegation, and request it to withdraw the same if it can’t.
We are clear that Nishan Kharel or any other Nepali reserves the rights to serve in the US or British or Indian army, or army or other security force of other countries, and it is a matter of individual choice for the person concerned.
Setopati stands for personal freedom of any individual. We don’t believe that moral questions can ever be asked of anyone on the basis of whether the person stays in Nepal or abroad, or serves in the Nepal Army or army of another country. People take decisions on the basis of their convenience and wish in different situations, and act accordingly. It is their individual and sovereign right if the decisions they take or their action do not harm others and do not violate the laws. We always respect those rights, and will always strive to protect those rights.
We also believe that the fact that a family member of a big leader or those who hold a major public position serves in a foreign army is a matter of interest for commoners, and hence a subject of news. We have, therefore, published the news of Nishan Kharel.
Those serving in the US Army should at least have permission for permanent residency in America. The person can easily acquire US citizenship after serving in the US Army. Nishan, who has been serving for seven years, should relinquish Nepali citizenship if he has acquired US citizenship. Not doing so would be against the laws of Nepal. We had asked Nishan’s father Agni whether Nishan has acquired US citizenship or not as he still holds Nepali citizenship. He could not say about Nishan’s US citizenship with certainty. We have also included Agni’s response in the news report. It is unfortunate that a constitutional body like the Election Commission has made allegations against a news story that we have reported complying with the decorum of journalism and completing due processes.
Third, this news is not related to the upcoming elections. It, therefore, does not attract the election code of conduct, nor can the Election Commission instruct for removal of the news citing the code of conduct. The Election Commission is not the authorized body to seek explanation about the news published by any media house or instruct for its removal.
Fourth, this is not the first time the Election Commission has sought clarification from Setopati in the name of election code of conduct. During the last local elections held in May, too, the Election Commission had sought clarification from us and instructed us to remove an election-related news. We had sent our clarification to the Election Commission refusing to remove the news.
That time the Election Commission had accused Setopati of violating the code of conduct by publishing election analyses based on conversations with voters of different local bodies. We were clear then and we are clear today as well that a voter has the right to privacy regarding who they want to vote for in an election. They need not reveal why they would or would not vote for somebody.
Also, voters also have the right to freedom of expression to publicly state why they would or would not vote for a candidate. Not only that, citizens also have the right to be politically organized, solicit votes for a political party and organize rallies.
Similarly, if any citizen tells a journalist without hesitation why she would or would not vote for somebody, what politician she likes or doesn’t like, whom she wants to help get elected or defeated, then a media house has the right to publish it. The Constitution itself has guaranteed that right and also defined its limits.
If it deems it necessary to ban the press from writing on something not prohibited by the Constitution and justifies that, then the legislature should formulate a law for it. The Election Commission cannot prepare a code of conduct that prohibits writing on issues not prohibited by the Constitution and the laws. The Election Commission’s code of conduct is not a law. We have already stated this in our earlier written clarification to the Election Commission.
Therefore, we urge the Election Commission to not discourage the press time and again, in the name of code of conduct, from reporting citizens’ views on political parties and leaders. We would also like to remind the Election Commission that such an act goes against the constitutional rights of citizens and the press.

On October 22 and 23, the Nepal Army (NA) organized a crucially important program to reflect on Nepal’s contribution to UN peace operations (PO). One of the several activities of the celebration was a seminar titled “Emerging capability requirements for UN Peace Operations and way forward” on October 23 at the NA headquarters where UN Under Secretary General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix virtually addressed the gathering. Chief Secretary of the Government of Nepal, NA Chief, and Military Advisor of the Secretary General of the UN and Nepal delegation head General Birame Diop were the other key persons to address the august gathering.
There were four presentations (3 from UN and 1 from NA) where I was also invited to make comments on presentations of two UN officials—“Developing and deploying capability needs for protection mandates” by Oliver Ulich (Deputy Representative UNHQ) and “Recommendations for TCCs like Nepal for generating and deploying suitable capabilities in UN Peace Operations” by Major General Hugh Van Roosen (retired).
The NA deserves special appreciation for organizing this very timely and highly relevant seminar and reflecting on our contribution to global peace, security and stability. It is equally important to critically look at what Nepal gained from this engagement and whether it is equitable compared to its contribution. Are we able to exhaust the potential for positioning Nepal as a champion of peacekeeping at the global level? What do we have to do to maximize our leverage and potential in this context and what should the UN think regarding the existing provisions of Troop and Police Contributing Countries (TPCC) in general and Nepal in particular?
Being a Nepali, I am very proud of the great contribution of our peacekeepers to maintaining international peace and security, one of the very foundational reasons of establishment of the UN in 1945, immediately after the Second World War by 51 countries.
That a Nepali peacekeepr accompanied the then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for the UN in 2001 is evidence of the importance of Nepali peacekeepers in the UN and the contribution of Nepal to the UN peace mission.
Nepal has gained unique experiences by engaging in achieving stability and peace in highly unstable countries like Lebanon, Iraq, Mali, South Sudan, DRC, Yemen, Libya, the Central African Republic, Syria, Israel, Western Sahara, South Sudan and many others, thereby providing us with a powerful negotiation tool with the UN for expanded engagement in the future.
According to a recently (on the seminar) unveiled coffee-table book about Nepal’s contribution to the UN by the NA, more than 140,000 Nepali troops have engaged in 43 UN peacekeeping missions around the world so far. At present, about 5,623 Nepali men and women are serving in 12 peacekeeping missions in different parts of the world.
Further, Nepal is one of the only two TPCCs that have formed military units in all protection of civilian (POC) missions. This also shows the commitment of Nepal toward the global peace and stability mission of the UN.
So far, Peace Operation (PO) of the UN is largely guided by narrow, top-down headquarters, and the burden loaded on TPCCs (for example, capability needs for protection mandates to be arranged on their own), which needs to be changed to become more relevant. Nepal being the second largest contributor to UN peacekeeping, this is a direct concern. Capabilities for protection should not limit to training, units and equipment, and personnel which UN is advocating but also include commitment of international support. Only then can it be termed “Whole-of-Mission Approach” and it should always cover all four protection mandates (protection of civilians, child protection, conflict-related sexual violence, and human rights).
Even though the three tiers of POC concepts—dialogue and engagement; physical protection; and establishment of protective environment—are pragmatic, it is essential to add security governance and civil military relations in the third component ‘establishment of protective environment’, to enhance trust, ownership and gain local support.
One of the weak concepts used in the UN military component about responsibilities at the strategic level is ‘Do No Harm’, which is a contextual operational concept developed by Mary Anderson in 1999 in the conflict-affected development context. The UN PO must strategically expand it to “Do Good” as the POC mandate itself is for doing good. Though the Action for Peace+ of the SG emphasizes on “Systemwise Digital Transformation Strategy” as a capacity tool for protection mandate, incorporating early warning and forecasting digital system deserves further consideration.
Based on the experiences of more than six decades of engagement of the NA in UN peace missions, it is the right time to holistically review and address the concerns raised in this paper.
The Government of Nepal must expand its engagement with the UN for maintaining international peace and security, developing friendly relations among nations and promoting social progress, better living standards and human rights, a very foundational aim of creation of the UN. It will be a win-win result for both Nepal and the UN. The following are some of the possible ways forward.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) must focus on expanding its sphere of influence for which we have three major potential areas.

First, Nepal has a great scope of positioning itself as a champion of global climate change debate because glacier melts and related crisis in the Hindukush Himalayas are global concerns. Hence, Nepal must globally and proactively engage on the issues of climate change and related insecurities.
Second, we have Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha. Nepal’s meaningful and strategic proactive engagement with Buddhist countries will provide a large number of tourists to Lumbini to noticeably enhance our economy.  These two issues are not direct concerns of this paper and I am not going to discuss it further.
The third and the most important one is expanding Nepal’s engagement in UNPO by a) increasing total number of troops aiming to be the top TPCC, b) providing a higher number of female peacekeepers, c) ensuring more officers in senior positions (eg force commanders) and d) sending civilian experts (eg on rule of law, justice, human rights, women empowerment, ceasefire monitoring, post conflict reconstruction, etc).
Achieving these points will not be easy. The MoFA must send capable UN representatives with a higher profile, better negotiation skills, full commitment and a desire to work hard to achieve them. It may require continuous, proactive and meaningful dialogue and negotiation with the UN Secretary General, Security Council and its members, members of General Assembly, and UN representatives of other countries.

Similarly, the Ministry of Defense must work hard to create a favorable domestic environment for achieving the points listed above. The NA has already offered to send 10,000 troops and must be ready and it must be realized as soon as practically feasible. By expanding our peacekeepers, Nepal will gain more experiences and expand the zone of influence in international peace and stability.
The Ministry of Finance must ensure financial provisions for armored personnel carriers (APCs) and other logistics on par with the standard of other TPCCs.
The NA must make sure that the police and soldiers deployed in French and Spanish-speaking countries get language training before their deployment.
The UN in general and UNSG and Department of Peace Operations in particular should categorize member countries into groups regarding the PO:
Troops and Police Contributing Countries (TPCCs) (who are providing a large number of troops),
Capability Contributing Countries (CCC) who are not providing a significant number of troops. They have to be responsible for capabilities and logistics (like airlifting planes, armored vehicles, training, information and technology, and so on).
Regarding the contribution of peacekeepers from Nepal, there is no representation of senior officials proportional to the troops (there are only 6 Force Commanders so far). Therefore, the UN must seriously rethink it and make sure that recruitment of senior officers is commensurate with peacekeepers (also necessary for equity). Nepal has proved and gained international repute as a country committed to upholding the principles outlined in the UN Charter and the UN must, therefore, consider this concern.

In conclusion, the UN as well as the member states, especially resourceful countries who have the responsibility to maintain international peace and stability as per the UN Charter, have to rethink PO in the changing global context and ensure fairness to TPCCs, recognize the contribution of certain countries like Nepal in fulfilling objectives of the UN to keep international peace and stability. Hence, Nepal must provide space to increase peacekeepers, senior officials and civilian officials.

Every post has its decorum and dignity. The post of president as a head of state also has its own decorum and dignity. The dignity of that post is related to the duties defined by the Constitution.
“Compliance and protection of the Constitution shall be the main duties of the President,” Article 61(4) of the Constitution states.
The oath of office and secrecy administered to the president also mentions, “Remaining completely faithful to the Constitution of Nepal…under prevailing laws…will perform with sincerity.”
President Bidya Devi Bhandari has failed in the main duty prescribed by the Constitution, and destroyed the decorum and dignity of the post of president.
There is a constitutional provision allowing the president to send back any bill submitted for authentication by the sovereign parliament for reconsideration. But the president must authenticate the bill within 15 days if the House again sends it to the president. She did not have any alternative to that and authenticating the Citizenship Bill was her constitutional duty.
Some legal professionals have argued that the Citizenship Bill has also automatically become inactive once the term of the House of Representatives (HoR) expired, and the president need not authenticate it. But that is not true.
“If the session ends when a Bill is still under consideration, the next session may take over the procedure.
Provided that, if a Bill is presented to the House of Representatives and is under consideration, or it is sent to National Assembly after passing it, but if the House of Representatives is dissolved while the Bill is still under consideration in the National Assembly, or if its tenure comes to an end, such Bill shall be considered not effective,” states Article 111(10) of the Constitution.
The Citizenship Bill was not under consideration in any House, and was submitted to the president after being endorsed by both the HoR and the National Assembly. The Constitution and laws do not envision any bill passed by both the HoR and the National Assembly becoming inactive. The Constitution, similarly, also does not envision the president not authenticating the bill sent to the president for the second time.
The president’s step, therefore, has raised serious questions about the Constitution and system. Can an individual who does not obey the Constitution continue as president or not? If we assume she can, then it will create a wrong precedent for those becoming president in the coming days. What will happen if a future president also defies any decision taken by the government or the parliament?
We will then be forced to wait anxiously whether the president will authenticate any bill sent after being passed by the House, whether the president will endorse the decision taken by the Cabinet or not. We will, in other words, reach a situation where the president, and not the parliament or the Cabinet with majority in that parliament, will exercise the sovereign powers of the people. That will vitiate our system in an irrevocable manner. That will afflict every prime minister that comes after election in the future and the parliamentary system. Every party that can get into the government will be eventually afflicted.
There is, therefore, the need for rule-based and long-term treatment of the arbitrariness displayed by the president now. One may say “The president did not honor the Constitution, we will also not honor the president.” Or even inform that the bill automatically comes into effect by publishing it in the Nepal Gazette. But that would be a response in rage. Anger does not make the Constitution and system stronger.
It is necessary to once again move the court to protect the Constitution and system, and to make them stronger, to take the president who has deviated from her responsibilities and constitutional duties to the dock of the court.
The court has already corrected President Bhandari for not fulfilling her constitutional duties appropriately. She had refused to appoint Sher Bahadur Deuba as the prime minister in accordance to Article 76(5) of the Constitution after 149 HoR members wrote to her to that regard defying the rights of the HoR to elect PM. The Supreme Court after a long hearing issued a mandamus instructing her to appoint Deuba as PM and administer oath of office and secrecy within 24 hours.
The SC, definitely, would look at this issue if anyone moves the court demanding that the president be asked to fulfill her constitutional duties. The court has already interpreted clearly that judicial remedy can be sought for presidential acts saying that the provision prohibiting filing of court cases against the president for works done in capacity of the president is limited only up to prohibiting making the president personally liable. But there remains no such limits about examination of the legal validity of the questions raised about use and implementation of the constitutional rights and provisions by the president.
That court verdict adds that no state official remains above the law or beyond the purview of law in a constitutional system incorporating democratic norms and values, and in rule of law. It reminds that keeping all presidential decisions beyond the purview of legal examination would ultimately lead to arbitrariness and autocracy.  
This precedent clearly shows that the court can look at the dereliction of the constitutional duty by the president in not authenticating the Citizenship Bill.
It is necessary to take this issue to the court and conclude it there to show constitutional limits to the president who displayed arbitrariness by not authenticating the bill submitted to her after being passed by the parliament, and also to remind her successors about those limits.

The Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) has been sending police and staffers with excavators in tow in the Hattisar area, where Tukucha has been put through an underground tunnel, for the past few days. They have been digging the ground in private houses of individuals and companies, demolishing walls, and threatening and instructing the owners to remove the structures. Owners of the houses and the land have been saying they have not encroached the land, rather procured it by completing legal procedures, built houses in accordance to the designs passed by the KMC and acquired documents of completing construction. With documents and evidence in hand, they have been pleading with the KMC to have a look at those documents. But the police and KMC staffers deployed on the field with excavators have not listened to their pleadings. They have been evading the owners saying, “Don’t tell us, ask engineers, and those above us.” And threatening that the houses will be demolished if found above the tunnel through which Tukucha is flowing.
A team of police and staffers reached the residence of 82-year-old Sharada Manandhar at Hattisar with excavators on Monday, shut the compound gate that was open, and then brought the gate down with the excavator. She had rented a small truss-structure inside the compound to a coffee house for the past four years. That was an additional source of income on top of her government pension. The KMC ordered her to demolish the structure stating that it is above Tukucha and warned that they will run the excavator if it is not demolished. The tenant has vacated the coffee house after KMC’s threats.
The police and KMC staffers are not to blame for all this, and its main leadership—Mayor Balen Shah—is the one responsible. He doesn’t want to check the facts of Hattisar, nor is he ready to listen to the locals. Yogesh Mishra, a local, met Shah at his office armed with documents and evidence, and tried to brief him about the facts but Shah was uninterested in his efforts, Mishra claims.
The KMC has started to display the brutality of excavators instead of looking at the facts and evidence presented by the locals, and presenting its own evidence to show that the locals have encroached the land.
What is this attitude showed by the KMC leadership, its police and staffers? It is necessary to call and define this mentality for what it is. This is blatant thuggery. The state’s thuggery over the law-abiding citizens is an unpardonable crime in democracy. And this crime needs to stop immediately.
The facts that we have unearthed, our conversation with locals of Hattisar, and the documents and evidence they have clearly show that they have not encroached the land. This is ancestral property of some; others had legally procured the land only some time back and built houses there. The land there has been sold and procured at government offices for years. Those who have built houses and other structures have done so after passing the design through the KMC and taking permission from other bodies concerned.
The land in Hattisar was never under government ownership. The land was owned by local farmers when the then Rana prime minister Bir Shumsher decided to put the Tukucha flowing out from the southern wall of the Narayanhiti Palace inside a tunnel 130 years ago. Historical documents have proved that the Ranas had acquired the land at Rs 200 per ropani. They constructed the underground tunnel for Tukucha and built a spacious ground by filling the tunnel but they never brought that land under the state’s ownership. That land was eventually distributed among Bir Shumsher’s children. Some of the plots there are still owned by Bir Shumsher’s descendants. Others have been transferred to the current owners after legal transactions.
The most important thing is, the land was surveyed in 1975. The map prepared then does not mention Tukucha. Not many may have remembered the Tukucha that was sent underground more than 80 years earlier. The state may also not have deemed it necessary to keep Tukucha in the map.
To say that the owners should have known about the Tukucha that was never mentioned in government map, and accuse them of encroaching the land over Tukucha and building houses is sheer insanity. The KMC has been doing precisely that now. To try to remove the locals from there through threats and excavator terror without completing any legal process and provision of compensation is an unthinkable act by the state. The Constitution has granted inviolable rights to property for the citizens. The excavators sent by Balen Shah cannot violate that, nor can the state take an ax to the private property of citizens without paying appropriate compensation.
The land and houses are not just physical properties for the people. They are connected with the person’s and her family’s love, sweat and many memories, and self-respect. The place is beloved for every individual with special importance and prestige. Where does the KMC get the rights to deploy excavators on such places without their permission when they have not committed any offense? Which morality granted that? Those hurting the self-respect of citizens by deploying excavators are liable for punishment in rule of law. Our law also deems attack on others’ properties a punishable offense.
There seems to be a frightening tendency now. A few individuals seem to be happy when the state has attacked others' properties. It is the nature of the crowd to take sadistic pleasure at the sufferings of others. That is understandable. But another dangerous tendency can also be seen in the Nepali society now—not speaking and writing against wrong deeds of Balen Shah due to his popularity. The victims of Hattisar have met Kathmandu lawmakers and leaders of parties and briefed their grievances. But the leaders have expressed helplessness saying, “We cannot speak against Balen Shah at such times.”
Expressing their helplessness, the victims say, “Politicians don’t listen to us, the media doesn’t write about us. What justice would the court provide during such a time?”
Some state bodies appear hesitant to fulfill their responsibilities. For example, it has come to light that the Tukucha tunnel was built 130 years ago by Bir Shumsher. Many say it was an amazing example of engineering for that period. The fact that the great earthquakes of 1934 and 2015 could not inflict any damage to the underground tunnel also clearly shows how strong the structure was built. Therefore, it is our heritage of historical and archeological importance that shows the engineering technology of the Rana period. According to law, no structure older than 100 years can be altered or demolished. It can only be altered under the supervision of the Department of Archaeology. The law has given that authority to the Department of Archeology. But the department seems reluctant to fulfill its responsibilities. It has remained silent even when the KMC’s excavators have been digging up such an old heritage every day. It has not even bothered to go and inspect the sites of excavation.
If society starts bowing down to populism like this, then democracy will start losing its essence. Therefore, it is necessary to speak and write about this injustice meted out by the KMC to the citizens so that those who are facing injustice do not lose their hope for justice. A democratic society is also a society that puts faith in justice in each other. Those who face the wrath of the state are left alone only in an autocratic society, where everyone fears the state.
Thankfully, there is also a good side to a populist wave—populism is usually short-lived. And people in a democratic society will challenge it sooner or later.
What now?
First of all, the thuggery needs to be stopped. The KMC needs to bring the excavator terror to an end and stop threatening the citizens.
And the KMC should discuss the issue with a cool mind in its executive meeting, and take decision in light of the facts that have come to the fore. It should consider whether the Tukucha tunnel has to be demolished or not? The settlement of Hattisar has to be displaced or not? The cost for doing so, the return on the expenses incurred, and whether that can be justified considering other glaring priorities of the KMC?
There will be debate in the media and the civil society on what to do about Tukucha, and whether to revive it or not. People will put their own positions on different aspects of the issue. That is inseparable and essential in a democratic society. That will bring many aspects of the disputed issue to the fore, and help the decision-makers take decision. But the sovereign rights to take a call rest on them in capacity of the elected people’s representatives. The Constitution has provisions specifying what the local government, the provincial government and the federal government can do. Everyone should fulfill one’s responsibility accordingly.
If the settlement has to be evacuated, the KMC must hold friendly dialogue with the locals about compensation. They should not be treated like enemies. Both the sides should agree and move forward accordingly. The Government of Nepal should take decision in accordance to the Land Acquisition Act if there is no such agreement, and pay compensation accordingly. And move the works forward.
No government has the authority to ignore the laws, processes and regulations, and unleash excavators on an individual’s property taking a mob, threaten the citizens and oppress them. That is not accepted in a civilized and democratic society.

Reporting of incidents of sexual assaults in Nepal has increased significantly in the last 10 years. More survivors are opening up as a result of social media's growth and the global #MeToo movement. Such violations have a wider impact than is generally thought. Cases of sexual abuse also have an underlying effect on mental health, in addition to the legal and socioeconomic repercussions. To comprehend how such events worsen survivors' mental health, sufficient research and studies have not been conducted.
A 24-year-old girl from Baglung in western Nepal was frequently raped by her father-in-law for a few years. Her husband was abroad for employment during that period. When this incident came out, her father-in-law accused her of infidelity and questioned her ""character"". Though authorities are investigating this matter, her mental health has deteriorated to the point that she has lost most of her senses.
Delay in filing cases for these crimes has deteriorated many survivors' mental health, according to journalist Nisha Oli. The majority of survivors take their time opening up. Their mental health is further hampered by this delay.
The road to rehabilitation is not easy, she continues. Most of the time, survivors are unaware of the necessity. Additionally, there are no agencies or groups that serve as mediators to ease the changeover. Although we are not professionals, I have observed various psychiatric issues among survivors. We can only help them along. The predicament is alarming.
While every instance of sexual abuse is unique, the effects it has on women and girls are often the same.
A 25-year-old traumatized survivor is now residing at a hostel in Kathmandu. The abuser has fled, and she is a long way from receiving justice. Her life has been turned upside down. Her life has changed since her mother passed away. Her father soon moved on after getting remarried. She is living alone now that her grandmother has passed away. For her, this was not the end.
She was assaulted at the home of a relative. Nobody believed her. Rather, she was blamed by many. At that point, everything for her was altered. She has been experiencing mental, physical, social, and psychological difficulties for the past nine years. She started to get suicidal tendencies. She spoke about the events in a very frank manner, unlike the majority of survivors.
Her attempts to get assistance were unsuccessful. However, neither the police nor the public gave her any credit. She contacted many groups, but none of them were able to assist. Organizations like the National Women’s Commission and Maiti Nepal responded in a lukewarm and disappointing manner. They also made fun of her for having mental health issues. They heightened the suffering. Numerous survivors have similar life experiences. Commission employees treat survivors like animals. They torture sufferers instead of offering consolation and compassion. There are numerous instances of survivors who have made it to Anuradha Koirala, the founder of Maiti Nepal, and then returned home sobbing. One of the survivors declared, ""All that glitters is not gold.”
Many of the responsible groups have utterly failed in this regard. These groups frequently throw temper tantrums, including berating, requesting that survivors contact the police or bring attorneys, and refusing to offer assistance. The persistent lack of empathy displayed by these institutions hurts the survivors. According to many analysts, social organizations and government entities are found wanting on this issue. Simply put, there is a lack of knowledge, urgency, and priority.
Journalist Nisha Oli claims that survivors have access to safe shelters. These safe houses offer lodging, help with processing abortions, and limited therapy. However, there are little long-term benefits from short-term counseling. According to Nisha, counseling should not only concentrate on giving support but also assist in the development of life skills. These skills bring financial independence and respect.
A Nepali girl claimed a few months ago on her Instagram and Tiktok pages that she had experienced several rapes and other forms of torture. She went on to say that the trauma caused by these sexual assaults had ruined her life and left her with despair, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
She revealed the abuser's identity and the circumstances she had to deal with after numerous instances of sexual assault in a video that was posted on TikTok and Instagram. There was widespread outrage over this across the nation. Massive rallies and demonstrations demanding justice for her were held in its wake. Her candor inspired many women and girls to talk about their traumatic experiences. The parliament heard debates over the statute of limitations for such crimes.The struggle against sexual assault has gained the much-needed spark.
The case, according to many experts, is just the beginning. The number of sexual assault cases that have been reported has sharply increased in recent years; 2144 and 2230 rape cases were reported in the fiscal years 2018–2019 and 2019–2020, respectively. There were 981 instances in the fiscal year 2014–2015, marking a 10-year high for the number. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey, 7% of women and girls (15–49) nationwide have reported experiencing sexual assault at some point in their lives. Even if the rates are rising, it is believed that they are actually even higher. Many women have been forced to keep such crimes to themselves due to the sensitive nature of crime.
Due to survivors' lack of knowledge about their legal rights and the lack of assistance they receive from friends and family, most of such incidents of sexual assault go unreported or remain secret. Instead of demanding retribution from the offender, many times survivors are questioned about their character instead. As a result, the judicial procedure rarely takes place and most of the time, offenders get away scot free.
The mental health support group Umanga Nepal carried out a poll on a small sample of women. Eighteen adolescent girls were surveyed, and the results showed that 15 of them experienced various forms of sexual abuse. Rape, attempted rape, sexual harassment, and sexual misbehavior were all covered. The majority of them experienced maltreatment as children, and they are still traumatized by it. In most cases, family members, friends, coworkers, boyfriends, and strangers were the culprits. Nine of the 18 females experienced abuse in their own homes when aged 10-14 years from family members and neighbors.
The majority of them struggle with anxiety, sleep problems, trauma, and challenges of trust. Their relationships and profession have both been harmed by this. Their confidence and aspirations have been destroyed by the trauma of such an event. Many of the victims have not yet sought legal representation or confronted their abusers. Social hierarchies and taboos are to blame to this. Fears of judgment, marginalization, and victimization are just a few among them. The majority of poll respondents experience guilt, shame, and panic. They are all guilty of self-blame. Survivors of sexual abuse are frequently at risk for mental health problems because of the trauma brought on by such occurrences and the self-deprecating emotions they elicit.
Sexual-abuse survivors are more prone to experiencing traumatic disorders and trust issues, according to psychotherapist Sita Lama from Mann Ka Kura, who has experience of working with trafficked girls and women. The majority of them are compelled to live with the trauma because they are reluctant to discuss freely about their mental health due to their family history, fear of criticism, and fear of being judged.
She concurs that it takes time for those who have experienced molestation during their formative years or at any other time to open up and find courage. Even if they do open up, they are uncomfortable conversing. In a few instances, people arrive looking for assistance for their ""friends."" But the majority of the time, it's their own tale.
“Even if they visit us, they are not at ease. Counselors must speak to clients in a way that encourages them to open up and begin believing in us. Some of them crumble and despise their own bodies,” she continues.
The slogan, according to Lama, is ""It's not our fault."" Acknowledging pain is the first step on the road to recovery. Dance therapy, behavior therapy, and art therapy can all aid with trauma reduction. However, recovery takes time. It won't happen overnight. Every instruction must be followed. It takes some time to find the wound and heal it.
When we respect and cherish our bodies, we can communicate with them mentally and emotionally. We are not to blame for anything that has happened to us in the past. In light of this, Lama considers loving and caring for the body to be one of the most crucial tasks.
Trauma is merely the beginning of the agony trail. Substance misuse is one of the main effects of such trauma. Most survivors take this route to get away from their experience. One of the survey's survivors related a similar experience. Drunken urges to temporarily flee are very likely. Many survivors still take drugs despite being aware of their negative effects. Unprescribed medications are more hazardous than helpful, as has been universally accepted and empirically demonstrated.
Sexual assault cases are not limited by gender or color. It has received a lot of discussion and condemnation. Studies and research of various kinds are being conducted. According to a study by Boston-based Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health professor Karestan Koenen, sexual assault and harassment ""often take a significant long-term toll on a victim's mental and physical health, increasing the risk for not only depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but also high blood pressure and sleep loss.""
""Not everyone who has been assaulted or harassed will endure persistent and lifelong repercussions. Being surrounded by a lot of supportive social networks can be beneficial for some people,"" she claimed. But a lot of folks aren't, Koenen continued. “Many women avoid discussing their experiences with others, often for years, out of concern that they won't be believed or that they would be referred to as ""nuts"" or ""sluts."" They, therefore, keep a secret from others, which wears them down over time and prevents them from receiving the assistance they require. Additionally, these encounters are extremely taxing on a bodily and psychological level.""
Sexual assault instances come in a variety of forms, according to Ram Pukar Shah, a clinical psychologist at Kanti Bal Hospital and CEO of the Subha Mangal Group. Some individuals discover the information after the fact.
""Our conversations are private. We start by getting a better grasp of the clients' behavior, interests, and character attributes. We don't rush because it's a delicate subject and it takes victims a long time to open up. We start by diagnosing the problems, whether they are anxiety, PTSD, or depression.
“Sometimes it's necessary to refer a patient to a psychiatrist and prescribe medicine as well, allowing therapy and medication to work in concert. We try several approaches based on the situation and the severity of the condition. There is therapy for trauma. We have to convince them that they are secure.
“Some survivors recover on their own with counseling, while others require behavioral therapy. Multiple abuse victims require extra time to recover. However, developing trust with your therapist or counselor is a crucial step.
“However, psychological counseling and therapy are still in their infancy in a nation like Nepal. The industry has come under fire for lacking professionalism and accessibility. Whoever is sincere and nonjudgmental is a true professional,” Shah continues.

Dipendra Kunwar has been promoted to Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) of the Armed Police Force (APF) in a way that he is ranked top from his batch.
He has not topped his batch due to his capabilities. He is not only incapable compared to others from his batch but was not even eligible to be recommended for promotion now. But he has been recommended as the highest ranked among his batch mates after pulling strings due to his relation with the political leadership at Baluwatar.
Kunwar is the husband of Bhanu Deuba’s sister. Bhanu Deuba is the nephew and personal secretary of Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba. Kunwar, who has been recommended for promotion to SSP, in this way is the son-in-law of PM Deuba.
He has been pushed forward in a fraudulent manner in a way that he becomes APF chief in the future because he is a relative of the Deuba family.
The promotion committee under the Home Ministry chaired by the Home Secretary decided to recommend 14 Superintendents of Police (SP) to SSP on Friday. Kunwar has been ranked second overall behind Praveen Kandel, who joined the APF from the Nepal Police and is set to retire soon, and top among his batch mates.
The APF regulation, which required APF personnel to serve for at least four years in a position to become eligible for promotion in the APF, was amended for Kunwar’s promotion. Kunwar would complete four years as Superintendent of Police (SP) only in April 2023. So, the government amended the regulation on July 6 and changed the eligibility to three years.
Kunwar had joined the APF as inspector on March 21, 2003. He was ranked toward the bottom of the 74 inspectors of his batch. But he was ranked 10th from among his batch mates when he was promoted to SP from Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), and has now been made top-ranked among his batch mates.
Bishnu Prasad Bhatta, who was the top-ranked inspector among the 74 from Kunwar’s batch, has now been ranked behind Kunwar while being promoted to SSP.
The main objective for promoting him now as the top-ranked among his batch mates is to make him Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police first and then Inspector General of Police (IGP).
There are currently three vacancies for DIG in the APF. There is no experience eligibility for DIG as in junior positions and Kunwar will directly become a candidate for DIG as Kandel, who is top-ranked among the newly promoted SSPs, would retire before becoming DIG due to age limit. Kunwar, who is ranked behind Kandel, would be an obvious claimant to IGP.
One must pass staff college to become DIG of the APF. Kunwar has twice failed entrance examinations for staff college. But the APF leadership took a special decision to send him to the staff college of Nepal Army (NA) at Shivapuri for the course even though only the best few APF officers are sent to the Nepal Army staff college. It is, in this way, clearly apparent that he completed staff college due to political backing.
SP Kunwar’s promotion is directly connected to PM Deuba. The PM or his secretariat is at the center of how he has been illegitimately recommended for promotion, that too in a way that he is ranked top among his batch mates.
It is now PM Deuba’s responsibility to either prove that the facts that have been uncovered about Kunwar now are false or revoke his unlawful recommendation. Deuba is guardian of all those serving the nation through NA, Nepal Police, APF and civil service in his capacity as the executive head of the country. The government led by him cannot mete out injustice to anyone.
Deuba’s responsibility as a PM elected by the people is toward the country and not his family. Democracy is a system of government of the people but all the citizens cannot go to the Singha Durbar and govern as that is not practically possible. The citizens, therefore, should govern through their representatives. The government or the leadership of government, in this manner, is the representative of citizens governing in their stead.
It is the responsibility of those in the leadership to use that for the larger good of the citizens. It is arbitrary to shirk one’s responsibility and take any decision for the benefit of oneself or those close to oneself. Arbitrariness of the leadership is unacceptable and unpardonable in democracy.
There is also another side to this.
It is a legitimate expectation of every police officer to be top-ranked if she has performed well, has displayed integrity in behavior, excelled in work, and is more qualified than other contenders.
“The issue of promotion to IGP is not just an issue of the government’s pleasure but is also an issue of the rights and legitimate expectation of the candidates concerned,” reads a Supreme Court verdict curtailing the arbitrariness of the government in IGP appointment.
PM Deuba cannot trample on the legitimate expectations of any qualified police officer to promote his relative even now. Display of such arbitrariness by those in the government can harm the police organization in the long run.  
If there is no environment where a new officer who has recently joined the police force can expect to become the IGP in the future because she believes she is the best police officer based on her conduct and capabilities, then why would anyone strive to become a good police officer? She will then try to curry favor with politicians and arrange money to offer to higher-ups. What will happen to the security of the country and the citizens then? Discrimination against public servants by every political party and leadership when in power will kill their dreams. That will, in turn, give rise to despair and increase malpractices in police and administration.
It does not suit somebody like PM Deuba, who has even endured life in prison during such a long political career, to promote his relative causing injustice to others. More than that, this is blatantly immoral.
We urge PM Deuba to immediately intervene and revoke the unlawful recommendation for promotion of his relative, protect the rights of other police officers, give them justice and save himself from yet another stain on his name.

The issue of grave controversy that Finance Minister Janardan Sharma has been mired is no longer limited to the Finance Ministry. The main responsibility for accountability definitely is Minister Sharma’s. But the buck stops with Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba as chairman of the Cabinet and Chairman of Sharma’s party Pushpa Kamal Dahal now that Sharma has run away from accountability.
It is now PM Deuba’s responsibility to either prove that Finance Minister Sharma has not committed any offense or to immediately fire him and conduct an investigation. It is CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman Dahal’s responsibility to take initiative for that or at least support it as Sharma is minister from his party.
We don’t know whether the grave allegations against Sharma that unauthorized persons entered the Finance Ministry premises in the midnight and corrected the tax rates in the budget to serve vested interests are true or not.
But after the closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage episode we firmly believe that the issue should not be resolved without judicial or parliamentary investigation. Sharma can return to the ministry if he is proved innocent but he should be liable for legal and political punishment if his involvement in this grave crime is established.
The issue for investigation is simple and clear. Had any unauthorized person entered the Finance Ministry in the midnight a day before the budget was presented in the federal parliament or not?
Minister Sharma has publicly claimed that no unauthorized persons entered the Finance Ministry at the time of finalizing the budget. We can give him benefit of doubt, if it can be given at all, only until the investigation on CCTV footage is completed. The investigation will find him innocent or guilty.  
The irresponsible response that the Finance Ministry has given stating that the CCTV footage can be retained only for 13 days in the right to information (RTI) request filed by a citizen seeking footage of the ministry at the alleged time of crime has made this issue graver.
There are two sides of the CCTV footage episode. The first is the right of citizens for access to and surveillance of the works done by the state. The second is the responsibility of the Finance Ministry to keep the CCTV footage safe for at least three months.  
Nepal has formulated law related to RTI. The spirit of that law is clear—the citizens have the right for surveillance of any work done by the state, any state organ or any official in that organ in a democratic country. They can seek information related to that in writing.
The right of such surveillance of the politicians elected by the people and who are remunerated by the taxes paid by them is fundamental in a democratic system. It is the duty of every politician to be sensitive toward the right granted to the citizens by the law and comply with it. They cannot shirk from their responsibility.
The RTI has been granted considering that politicians or any authorized person can take decision in a dark room against public interest for self-interest of them or others to ensure that they can make such decisions public and resist against those decisions.
The citizens have been fulfilling their responsibilities toward democracy by electing politicians through their votes even in the most adverse conditions on the one hand. They have also been bearing the financial burden of keeping the state functioning by paying taxes despite the financial difficulties they face on the other.  
It is, therefore, necessary to imbibe that the rights of citizens for surveillance of the state and politicians is inviolable.  
How important the issue of a citizen seeking CCTV footage of the Finance Ministry automatically becomes clear once one accepts this basic tenet. It is legal and moral responsibility of the Finance Ministry leadership to provide the footage sought completing legal procedures.  The ministry has shirked from this responsibility by giving a written response that the ministry’s CCTV footage can be retained only for 13 days.  
The Home Ministry’s guidelines about installation and operation of CCTV requires footage of CCTV cameras be kept safe for at least three months and adds that the district administration office concerned can investigate about the CCTV footage. The footage of May 28, therefore, should be kept safe at least until August 28.
The gravity of allegations against Minister Sharma has increased further after the ministry’s response that it does not have the footage of the final night before the budget was presented in the House. He should not be exonerated of this episode without investigation which should start by immediately removing him as minister.
Technological experts can retrieve the footage even if it has been lost. The wrong intentions would be automatically proved if the footage has been deleted in an irretrievable manner.
PM Deuba and Maoist Center Chairman Dahal do not have the luxury of ignoring this episode. Their support for Sharma, if not implication, will be clearly established if they do so.

During the monsoon season, almost every day, we wake up to some hazardous events such as landslides and floods and their devastating impact on people and society. Over the last decade Nepal experienced a number of major floods, landslides, windstorms, lightnings, public health-related and other monsoon hazards that caused loss of lives and livelihoods. This explains the diversity of hazards that Nepal faces and underscores the importance of more predictable and accountable disaster management.
2022 monsoon outlook and preparedness
The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) estimates around two million people can be potentially affected by the monsoon hazards in 2022. Based on this caseload all three levels of government—federal, provincial, and local—together with humanitarian partners including the private sector have been engaged in preparedness and readiness activities to effectively respond to the potential monsoon disasters.
However, there are questions about effective implementation of such plans and policies. For example, when there is a disaster, provisions on such plans are overlooked. All the disaster management committees at local, district, provincial and federal levels convene and take some generic decisions. Often there is redundancy in the decisions and no follow-up. Coordination with other relief providers such as volunteer groups, private sector and civil society is ad-hoc. In the name of one-door policy, relief activities are held up. Often relief workers find it difficult to navigate the complexities and reach to the population in need of support.
“Funds and materials get allocated. There is never a serious shortfall, but the governance mechanism which is needed most during the time of crisis becomes more confusing. Whenever there is a disaster situation everybody in the bureaucracy and the political system, from ward member to the prime minister, gets engaged,” says Krishna Lamichhane, a Red Cross worker in Nawalparasi of Lumbini province. “They try to politically capitalize on the humanitarian situation and make a trip to the affected site. But real relief work takes a hit.” Lamichhane believes empowering front-line Red Cross network would improve delivery.
Front-line governance
An accountable and predictable approach is required to timely protect lives and livelihoods from hazards and ensure effective disaster response. The Constitution of Nepal has entrusted the local bodies with an exclusive jurisdiction and responsibilities in disaster management. The local officials including elected ward officials, police, health workers and Red Cross are the first responders and manage the relief efforts in the critical early hours of response.
Given their detailed knowledge of the community, the local bodies are best able to identify hazards, assess vulnerabilities and design appropriate policies to reduce and manage risks. Local officials are well positioned to spearhead disaster preparedness planning. Moreover, many practical local measures can be implemented at the local level to ensure disasters are managed locally as much as possible and nationalized only when it is necessary.
Although local bodies bear primary functional responsibility for disaster management, local capacity particularly in disaster response is weak. The local bodies lack own search and rescue workers and technical expertise. The district authorities, which are federal government entities, maintain the capability in search and rescue, and support the local bodies. Post-disaster analyses essentially reveal that local disaster management capacities are weak and underfunded.
In addition to the technical capabilities, local decision-making process has to be effective and efficient. “The governance mechanism has to be facilitating and coordinating in responding to disasters or other problems in the society,” says Deputy Mayor of Rajapur Municipality in Bardiya Mankala Kumari Chaudhary. She emphasizes that necessary guidelines, protocols and standards have to be developed and updated by the government. To have predictability in governance, there must be accountability of the elected officials and the institutions and partnership with wide range of actors in the society.
Transforming traditional governance to anticipatory approaches
Given the unpredictability in hazards, the country needs to move away from the traditional form of reactive approach to more anticipatory approaches. The anticipatory approaches are the ability to harness the collective intelligence and wisdom of collaborating with organizations and citizens. According to Leon Fuerth (2009), anticipatory governance is “a system of institutions, rules and norms that provide a way to use foresight for the purpose of reducing risk and to increase capacity to respond to events at early rather than later states of their development.”
Better disaster preparedness and anticipatory governance could be achieved by emphasizing readiness for all types of hazards and involving multiple dimensions including mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery.
Nepal has started practicing anticipatory governance approach in disaster management one way or the other. For instance, the government, security forces and other partners annually organize simulation and drill exercises before the onset of monsoon season. These exercises are important in diagnosing shortfall in disaster response plan and mechanisms and help in fostering strong working relationships among the responders.
The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has been providing three-day and the long-range forecasts. Based on these weather forecasts, authorities disseminate early warning messages to the communities. The local governments and relief organizations are able to implement some preventive and mitigative measures before there is a flood.
Also, there is an ongoing discourse on strict implementation of land use policy to reduce the impacts of hazards. The land use regulations that prohibit construction on risky land such as flood plains contribute to averting the disaster. “Traditionally, the community and its leaders have set norms and rules on the land use and zoning of land. The land was classified based on its nature and topography. But these days with boom in real estate every piece of land, even dangerously sloping land, is being bulldozed,” says Khagendra Pant, local high school teacher in Bhajani, Kailali.
The NDRRMA is leading scenario-based preparedness which involves analyzing underlying risk and vulnerabilities to different hazards and developing caseloads. The authority asks different ministries, departments and partners to prepare a plan based on those scenarios and caseloads. It also involves measuring a community’s capability to respond effectively—such as planning for the evacuation sites for people living with disability. The NDRRMA has embraced the principles of risk management in its disaster preparedness and response approach. Risk-based emergency planning involves assessment of the risk a community is likely to face, and estimation of probable impacts associated with these risks over a specific period. The process of identifying, analyzing and prioritizing risk is increasingly regarded as the optimal means to allocate scarce emergency management resources.
Call to action
The underlying risk posed by the climate change and unpredictability in the hazard patterns warrant anticipatory governance to take preventative and mitigating approaches in saving lives and livelihood. It’s high time we made disaster response and recovery work more predictable, accountable, and responsive. With these unprecedented challenges, the policy development requires speed. Some policies must be developed and updated within a short period of time. The scope of the policy work and problem of the communities need to be adequately diagnosed. Additionally, resources from each level of government should be brought to the table and inter-governmental collaboration should be forged. This is how a system that is able to respond to the unexpected crises arising from climate change can be built.
To make disaster response anticipatory, a multi-hazard early warning system has to be put in place. A system that is able to cope with any foreseen and unforeseen crisis requires updating and activating the communication networks across provinces, districts, local bodies and practitioners.

The politics is heated in the past few days due to the State Partnership Program (SPP) of America. Facts and lies alike regarding the SPP have come to the fore.
Foreign Minister Narayan Khadka’s comments about the SPP in the House, the US Embassy’s briefing to journalists, the statement issued by the Nepal Army (NA) and speeches by politicians in accordance with their interests have created confusions instead of clarifying about SPP.
The US Embassy invited journalists and stated that no draft of SPP agreement has been submitted to the Government of Nepal. It also claimed that Nepal had applied to participate in SPP in 2015 and 2017, and the application was approved in 2019.
The then Nepal Army (NA) Chief Rajendra Chhetri had applied for partnership on both the occasions and the NA had copied both the applications to the Defense Ministry and the Foreign Ministry of Nepal, according to the US Embassy.
The NA issued a statement Wednesday evening claiming that no agreement or understanding has been signed about the SPP. ""The Nepal Army has not signed any agreement or understanding about the SPP with the US Army or government, and there is no process toward signing such agreement,"" the NA statement says. ""The Nepal Army is always clear about the objective fact about not doing military partnership in the future with anyone in a way that can adversely affect the non-aligned foreign policy adopted by Nepal and Nepal's special geopolitical location and strategic sensitivities.""
The NA statement has mentioned that no agreement or understanding has been signed about the SPP but it has not spoken about the claims of the US Embassy that it had first applied for participation in 2015 and then again in 2017.
No agreement needs to be signed to participate in the SPP going by what the US Embassy says. Interested countries apply for participation and America accepts the application.
The Government of Nepal should now inform the House about all the facts related to SPP issuing a white paper. The issue will continue to create suspicions otherwise. It will become an issue for political one-upmanship and allegations and counter-allegations.
The NA must have copies of the applications submitted by the then NA Chief Chhetri in 2015 and 2017. The US Embassy’s claims that both the applications were also copied to the Defense Ministry and the Foreign Ministry of Nepal hint that the two ministries also have copies of the applications. The letter that Chhetri had sent in 2015 when KP Sharma Oli was prime minister (PM) has been made public Thursday.
But the letter said to have been sent in 2017 has yet to be made public and what exactly was written in that letter has yet to be known. America has said that it allowed Nepal to join the SPP in 2019 on the basis of these two applications.
The Government of Nepal should seek answers from America if the intention of those two letters was not to become part of the SPP and ask for removal of Nepal’s name from its website.
The government and the NA cannot be irresponsible and just say that they have not signed any agreement when America has listed Nepal as a member country of the SPP.
What may actually have happened is the NA asked for help from the US Army in disaster management after the Gorkha Earthquake in 2015. It may have applied for the SPP after the US Army likely responded that such assistance can be provided after receiving application for the SPP. The NA may again have applied in 2017 for similar assistance.
We don’t believe that the NA or the government led by any politician will knowingly decide to enter a long-term military partnership with America. Nobody seems to be in a state to definitively say about all the aspects related to the SPP today. Politicians, be those inside the government or in the opposition, seem more confused. They, however, are resorting to allegations and counter-allegations against each other even in this confusion. They are spending the time they should invest on understanding the issue and unearth the facts in making allegations.
CPN-UML—which has been the loudest in raising questions about the SPP both inside the House and outside to try to show that it is the only nationalist party, and create doubts about patriotism of others—is in an awkward position after it has been revealed that the first application for participation in the SPP was sent when the party led the government.
CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal seems to be in haste to allege that Oli made the deal as he led the government when America accepted Nepal’s application in 2019.
This nature of our politicians to resort to inflammatory allegations and counter-allegations on sensitive national issues instead of displaying appropriate gravity and sensitivity is not new. The allegations that politicians knowingly or unknowingly have levelled against each other since 1951 about nationalism and foreign policy have made Nepal weak in the eyes of foreigners the most. Leaders and parties are unfortunately repeating the same irresponsibility and rhetoric even on the issue of SPP.
We believe the politicians who try to depict only themselves as nationalists and always attack on patriotism and integrity of others, and publicly slander others calling them brokers are fake nationalists.
The need of the hour is to find out truth and facts about the SPP, make them public and conclude the issue forging national unity. The SPP is not merely a program for the US Army to assist other countries in issues including disaster management as claimed by the US Embassy and Foreign Minister Khadka in the House. Those things are also part of the SPP but the SPP is more than that.
An article about the main objectives of the SPP by a former chief of the American National Guard that cooperates with armies of different countries clarifies how broad the SPP’s scope is and what its main objectives are.
This definitely does not mean that the NA should not establish any relations with the US Army. The NA has relations with the armies of India, China, US and other countries for years. The NA participates in joint exercises with the Indian and Chinese armies every year. It also holds joint drills with the US Army.
The US Army has been providing training to the NA on disaster management, search and rescue, counter-terrorism and other areas. NA officials go to American war colleges and other organizations for studies and training on a regular basis. This practice had been continuing even before Nepal applied for the SPP.
What necessitated Nepal’s application for the SPP in recent years? How can we be assured that this application incorporates only these areas of cooperation between the NA and the US Army? Who will give the assurance?
Nepal cannot, and must not, enter the wide spectrum of partnership between the two armies under the SPP. On the one hand, we have our geopolitical sensitivity, and we have our constitutional commitment and responsibility toward non-aligned foreign policy on the other. If we follow the simple formula of aligning with all world powers on matters of economy and development while remaining non-aligned on strategic matters, it will not only help us achieve economic gains but also protect us from strategic tensions and risks.
Are the common people expecting too much from the political parties if they want all political parties to consign their past invectives against each other to history and stand together. If not, let us first make public all the facts related to the SPP through a white paper in the sovereign parliament. After that, let all the major political parties reach an agreement on how to resolve the issue of SPP.
Let the series of abusing and doubting each other on the issue of nationalism and foreign policy be stopped. Let us make Nepal a mature country that does not harm anyone, strongly stand for her interests, participates with everyone economically but remain strategically non-aligned in the eyes of our neighbors and friendly countries.
Are the politicians ready for that?

The committee formed by the government to invstigate the allegations made against Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) Governor Maha Prasad Adhikari reminds of kangaroo courts that autocrats across the world form to persecute their opponents and rivals.
Finance Minister Janardan Sharma has got Adhikari suspended by influencing Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba due to his ego and prejudice, and got a committee formed through the Cabinet to investigate Adhikari.
Sharma has not been able to publicly defend suspension of governor of an autonomous body like the NRB. Governors are not generally suspended unless they show serious moral depravity or knowingly harm the country. They must never be suspended on the basis of policy differences. 
The NRB can adopt a policy that differs from that of the government based on the needs of the economy. Political parties can disrupt the country's economy in accordance to their short-term interests or political needs. The NRB has been given autonomy precisely to ensure that it can pay attention to stability of the economy through monetary policy to stop that.  
Governor Adhikari had implemented the NRB policies in coordination with the government policies even in practice. The NRB and the government coordinate their policies at normal times and the finance secretary is kept in the NRB board for that purpose.
Adhikari has not acted to harm the economy defying the government or flouting government's instructions. He instead intervened and prevented hike in interest rate for a long time to fulfill the finance minister's wish to increase loan investment by banks keeping a low interest rate, and     raise economic activities and the economic growth rate. That is seen to have increased flow of cheap money into the economy, increased import and put pressure on foreign currency reserves now.
Some policies adopted with good intention can prove to be wrong in the long run and put pressure on the economy. No economy would suffer crisis if all the policies were proved right and accurate prediction of a crisis were possible. There is no country in the world that has never suffered an economic crisis. All the state organs, therefore, should have come together to find a solution to the problem currently facing our economy without blaming anyone.
Finance Minister Sharma instead has alleged Adhikari of not cooperating with the government, harming the economy, leaking important economic information among others to avenge on an absolutely different issue.
It is not hidden from anyone that Sharma has attacked Adhikari after revelations that he took initiative to release the money transferred in the name of Prithvi Bahadur Shah from America that the NRB has frozen after America requested the central bank to investigate and return the amount back to America suspecting that it may have arrived through money laundering or fraud. To take an initiative to release the amount that has been red-flagged by America was a serious mistake on part of the finance minister.
That he got the governor suspended suspecting that Adhikari leaked the information and a committee formed including persons close to him to investigate that shows that he is intent on practicing vigilante justice.
The kind of persons included in the 'kangaroo committee' formed on initiative of Sharma gives away what his intentions are. The committee that Sharma has got constituted through the Cabinet including a former justice who is his relative and two party cadres has ended the possibility of fair investigation of allegations made against the governor and chances for justice.
Constitution of such 'kangaroo committee' has made mockery of justice. Responsibility for that now lies not just with Sharma but Chairman of the Cabinet that formed the 'kangaroo committee' and his party Nepali Congerss (NC). Neither PM Deuba nor NC can now run away from that.
Practising 'kangaroo court' and vigilante justice is not new for the Maoists that had practiced so during the armed insurgency. But how could NC agree for that? It should declare whether any citizen has the right for fair investigation of allegations made against her in a liberal and democratic society it has promised to the people. Whether that is a fundamental right for any citizen in today's Nepal or not?  If yes, why is that right of Governor Adhikari denied? How could a Cabinet meeting attended by PM Deuba form such a 'kangaroo committee' on whims of Minister Sharma? On what basis the Deuba Cabinet endorsed such a decision that attacks the autonomy granted to the NRB and its governor by the law?
These questions raised against PM Deuba and NC led by him are not simple. This Cabinet decision to form the 'kangaroo committee' attacks the very trust that the people have on NC for  the kind of values and norms it swears allegiance to.
The only way to correct the mistake now is to revoke the 'kangaroo committee' and withdraw the suspension of Governor Adhikari. 
NC should mull whether the public trust on it for its values and norms is important or transient interests of ruling coalition and defnse of the finance minister's whims are?

Surgery is considered as one of the very rewarding disciplines providing good amount of personal and professional job satisfaction. Unfortunately, it is also considered as one of the most stressful professions. Both during the period of surgical training as well as clinical practice, people are prone to developing burnout due to excessive stress. Predisposing factors could be multiple. Multiple studies published overseas have demonstrated that the burnout rate among the surgical trainees and practicing surgeons is very high in comparison to other specialties.
Why surgeons are prone to stress?
In surgical specialties, the job demands extreme amount of hard work, both mentally and physically. Besides this, the working hours are extra-long and just not limited to fixed schedules, and the on-call duties are extremely tiring and long. Most of the times the surgeons are dealing with life-and-death situations and one small error either in judgment or skill can prove fatal. At some busy centers the surgeons are overloaded with patients too. Moreover, the training in surgical specialties is extremely prolonged and even after completing their general and specialty trainings they further need supervised working environment to gain good amount of exposure and develop enough confidence. Each individual surgeon can work independently only after that. These prolonged period of training leads to disbalance in their professional and personal life. Similarly, the compulsion to excel both in academics and surgical practice as well as trying to balance with economical aspects are important factors leading to development of burnout among surgeons. Failure to achieve balance in academic, clinical practice and personal life is again the most important factor for the development of stress among surgeons. Sometimes the pressure on the surgeons by the administration to increase performance also adds up the stress among the surgeons who are already prone to stress because of various predisposing factors. Increasing possibility of dealing with litigations in surgical practice is also one of the strongest factors for surgeons to experience stress and develop burnouts.
What is the prevalence of stress among surgeons?
Apart from some anecdotal reports and expert viewpoints, there has been no published study on this subject matter in Nepal till date. This is one of the very important areas to be researched in Nepal as surgical training and clinical practice in surgical specialties are increasingly becoming very challenging and competitive, and also invite risk of litigations. The number of surgeons in the country has also significantly increased. One US study published in “Surgery” journal in 2001, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, did a survey on 582 surgeons. Overall, 32% surgeons showed high levels of emotional exhaustion, 13% depersonalization and 4% showed low sense of personal accomplishment. Young surgeons were found to be more vulnerable to suffering stress. Similarly, another Australian study published in ANZ journal of Surgery in 2007 evaluated 126 Surgeons. They found that the surgeons were suffering high level of burnout than the general population. Around 48% of the surgeons surveyed reported high burnout levels. Besides these published reports, there are plenty of other overseas publications supporting the fact that the surgeons are very prone to developing burnout and suffering from stress. It has also been found that the experienced surgeons are more likely to have higher management ability as compared to those younger ones and with fewer years of experience.
What is the effect of stress among surgeons?
Burnout and stress can spill over to personal and professional life. Burnouts can lead to emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and low personal accomplishment. Besides this, stress can be significant contributor to poor health of a surgeon. Anxiety and depression can both be a reason for serious health issues among very stressed and burnt out surgeons. Suffering from broken relationships to drug and alcohol dependence can be a serious issue and at extreme situations they are also prone to suicidal tendencies in lack of timely intervention. Stress and burnout lead to imbalance between personal and professional life which further adds to the suffering of already stressed surgeons and this vicious cycle can continue. Job performance further deteriorates in those surgeons already under stress. This can in fact affect the outcome of the patients being treated. Thus, stress and burnouts have serious consequences which are not just limited to the surgeon suffering from it but also can affect the patient being treated and overall health services of a center.
How can we prevent that?
Despite the high prevalence of stress and burnout among surgeons, there are still ways to reduce it although it can’t be completely avoided. There is no best way to prevent it because it needs to be individualized based on every individual’s working condition, environment, job responsibilities and personalities besides many other factors to be considered. There are plenty of ways described in various published literatures to reduce and prevent stress among surgeons and surgical trainees which could in fact be applied to any other specialty too. The past experience of handling the stressful situation can be adopted even during surgical training periods and in clinical practice too. Identifying priorities both in personal and professional life is a must. One should understand and know one's limits as to what extent to be devoted to surgery. It may not be very applicable during training but definitely an important issue to be considered while practicing as a professional surgeon. Not everyone can do everything and one should understand one's limits and potential. Getting inspired from others is definitely rewarding but comparing oneself to others can unnecessarily increase the stress. Trying to balance between clinical, academic and personal life which also includes the financial aspects is a must. Running after one single aspect is definitely going to be non-rewarding and there is possibility of developing stressful situation due to self-understood reasons. Working in a team, sharing responsibilities and asking for help whenever required are of utmost importance in preventing stress and burnout among surgeons. A very supporting family can definitely help dealing with stressful situations. However, not everyone could be lucky enough to have a very understanding family or a colleague. Reading articles, publications and books on stress management can also help significantly.  For those having a concerning level of stress and burnouts participation in formal stress management training programs and also getting timely medical interventions can help. From the administrative perspective, imposing scientifically correct working hours and workloads both on trainees and practicing surgeons can help avoid unnecessary stress and decrease burnouts among these vulnerable population.
In conclusion, surgery is a very rewarding yet stressful discipline due to various reasons and surgeons both as trainees and practicing surgeons are prone to developing burnout and suffering stress. This can have various consequences not just limited to individual but also affecting the whole system. Thus, efforts should be made at the individual level to the level of administrators and stakeholders to prevent and reduce the prevalence of stress and burnout among surgical trainees and practicing surgeons which then will help in creating a safe working environment for service providers as well as increasing the patient safety.

The Nepal Academy has recently published photojournalist Bharat Bandhu Thapa's picture book 'Nepal in Pictures'.
The 320-page book includes over 500 photographs depicting tourism, arts, culture and society from Mechi in the east to Mahakli in the west and the height of Mt Everest to the lowlands of Kechanakaval. 
""My objective was to ensure that those who want to know Nepal get to see the main views and know the main specialties of the country in a single book. I was, therefore, working on it for a long time,"" Thapa tells Setopati. ""Nepal is such a big country that it is not possible to include the whole country in 320 pages. But I have tried to include different possibilities of the country as far as I know in this book.""
He added that the book will be polished further in the future. 
The pictures in the books depict places from Olangchung Gola in the east to Kalapani in the Far West, Khaptad, Badimalika, Upper Dolpo, Lumbini, Janaki Temple, Shukaphant to the culture of the Kathmandu Valley. ""Most of the pictures in the book have been clicked by me. But I have not travelled across the whole country. I was undecided about whether to include the places I have not visited or not,"" he reveals. ""I finally decided that those places should not be excluded from the book even if I have not visited.""
He has sought photos of those places from his friends and says that has prevented the book from being incomplete.

In an agricultural country like Nepal, where 66% of the population are farmers, and livestock covers 32% of agricultural GDP, one would expect the dairy industry to flourish as a testament to their toil. Yet, reality paints a different picture, revealing a disheartening tale of missed opportunities and untapped potential. The Milk Industry in Nepal has long been plagued by inefficiency and financial losses, primarily represented by the struggles faced by the Dairy Development Corporation (DDC). For decades, this state-owned entity has failed to achieve profitability, resulting in significant financial burdens on the nation’s hardworking taxpayers. This article delves into the pressing need for the privatization of Nepal's state owned DDC, highlighting its inefficiencies and the implications of its continued financial strain on the taxpayers. The article also advocates for a transition of the role of government in this sector that would alleviate this burden and foster a more vibrant and self-sustaining industry.
Firstly, let’s start by talking about the market for milk in Nepal. As per FAO/WHO, the demand for milk in Nepal is 92 liters per person per year, and the country produces 79 liters per person annually. It is estimated that the average current deficit is around 550,000 liters of fluid milk per day with 10-20 % variability during different seasons. According to the Department of Livestock Services (DLS), production is increasing at a rate of 3.4 % annually, but demand is growing at 8%. The average cost of per liter milk production in Nepal is around Rs 56.32. It is lowest in Ilam at Rs 45.37 per liter and highest in Sarlahi, at Rs 67 per liter.
When it comes to dairy development in Nepal DDC is a living history. However, like other state-owned enterprises in Nepal, it has inbuilt difficulties and incompetency. DDC is a significant player in the market, handling a disproportionately high share of 40% of milk production in the country. Regardless of a substantial market share over the past five years, the corporation has been experiencing massive financial losses. In the fiscal years 2019/20 and 2020/21, the company incurred losses of Rs 158.3 million and Rs 168 million, respectively. The loss trend continues in the year 2022 and 2023 which is substantiated by ongoing protests across various regions in Nepal, led by milk farmers affected by DDC's untimely payment practices. While other dairy companies are flourishing and expanding their portfolio DDC’s continuous loss alone is enough to prove its incompetency. Let’s delve deeper into the reasons behind the inefficiencies of the DDC, shedding light on the factors that have led to its downfall.
Supply Chain Incompetency
In 2020, DDC requested a concessional loan of Rs 300 million from the Ministry of Finance, facilitated through the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development. DDC had been unable to pay farmers for their milk for the past three months. According to them, there was approximately Rs 1 billion worth of dairy products in stock as they were not able to sell the product. DDC had also requested a subsidy of Rs 5 per liter from the Ministry of Agriculture for the consumption of 17 million liters of milk. This highlights a significant supply chain inefficiency as DDC, despite being a majority shareholder in the market, fails to capitalize on the existing deficit of 550,000 liters per day in the milk market.
Lack of Efficient Decision Making
During COVID, after DDC bought up to 100,000 liters of milk every day, they had problems managing the milk. Hence, the provincial government provided  Rs 50 million grant to upgrade the powder plant to be able to operate 24 hours a day and establish a new ice bank. The Biratnagar Milk Supply Scheme (BMSS), which upgraded the powder plant by expecting an increase in milk collection, is now, at times, completely non-operational till the interval of up to half a year due to insufficient milk collection. The BMSS is currently collecting 10,000 liters of milk daily. During the same period last year, the daily collection was 22,000 liters. Not only is DDC unable to meet the market demand, it has stopped the production of cheese. Their ghee has not been sent to the market for months. The short-term thinking and lack of foresightedness among the decision-makers have cost the taxpayers in millions.
Untimely Payment to Suppliers
In March 2023, the government fixed the minimum purchase price of raw milk containing four units of fat at Rs 65 per liter for the farmers. However, Farmers opt to sell their milk to private companies instead of DDC due to the private sector's provision of more competitive pricing and timely payment, thereby aligning with their economic interests. Private industries are buying milk by paying Rs 5-10 more per liter. The private sector is giving advance payment to the cooperatives, but DDC has been buying milk on credit for two months. Among the farmers, DDC has been known as a 'slow pay' company. The milk collection capacity of BMSS has been decreasing at a rate of 50 percent every year for the past few years. The Biratnagar project is in trouble as DDC is unable to bring milk from Ilam, where it collects the most milk. Until three years ago, about 12,000 liters of milk was collected daily from Ilam, now 3,000 liters are collected daily. Farmers are unwilling to sell milk to DDC due to due to lack of timely payment. Hence, the reluctance of farmers to sell milk to DDC, despite the milk production capacity of Nepal remaining intact, highlights the perceived inefficiency of DDC in effectively engaging with farmers and establishing a mutually beneficial relationship. This demonstrates the superior efficiency of the private sector in this industry, as it not only offers competitive prices to farmers but also manages to sell milk to consumers at the same price as DDC. Consequently, this approach avoids any loss of taxpayers' money.
Inefficient Use of Resources
In Nepal, there are two seasons based on milk production at the farmers' level. During the lean season, the demand for milk is higher than the supply and during the flush season, the demand is lower than the supply. Even today, DDC is not able to buy all the milk offered by the farmers, especially during the flush season. As a consequence, DDC imposes a milk holiday on certain days during the period when they do not buy any milk from the farmers. On the other hand, during the lean season, DDC has either been importing skimmed milk powder to meet consumer demand or buying milk from private companies. In the Indian market, the base price of milk stands at Rs 70 per liter, whereas in Nepal, it is merely Rs 64 per liter. The inability of DDC to powder and store milk exclusively during the flush season not only leads to significant financial losses for the organization but also imposes these losses on the general public. If private companies can efficiently utilize resources and maintain a consistent price throughout all seasons, there is little justification for bailing out DDC, which has been purchased from these very private companies at the expense of public losses.
Corruption and Lack of Accountability
Lack of accountability and corruption is a very common cause of inefficiency of Public Enterprises in Nepal. The stakeholders often act on their self-interests rather than the interests of the organization as they have very little incentive to maximize the organizational profit. Additionally, the government often appoints unqualified or underqualified individuals to top positions based on political connections rather than merit, resulting in poor decision-making, lack of accountability, and a culture of corruption. DDC is indifferent to this and has been plagued by inefficiency due to rampant corruption within the organization. This has hindered the corporation's ability to fulfill its objectives and has negatively impacted its overall performance. One glaring example is highlighted in a report from 2016 which exposed DDC officials who were found involved in accepting commissions. Such unethical practices not only undermine the corporation's integrity but also result in the misallocation of resources and compromised decision-making processes. When officials prioritize personal gain over the interests of the organization, it leads to inefficiencies in the procurement, production, and distribution of dairy products.
Furthermore, another report shed light on another form of corruption within DDC which revealed instances where service-seekers were forced to pay bribes to officials in Saptari DDC. This kind of extortion erodes public trust in the corporation and discourages genuine service-seekers from engaging with the organization. It also creates an uneven playing field, where those with connections or the ability to pay bribes receive preferential treatment, further exacerbating the inefficiencies of the organization.
Lack of Audit Reports
The absence of audit reports of DDC for seven consecutive years raises significant questions about the financial transparency and accountability of the organization. Audits play a crucial role in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of financial statements, detecting fraud or mismanagement, and providing insights into the overall financial health of a company. The lack of audits undermines these essential functions, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty and casting doubts on the financial integrity of DDC. These reasons could range from administrative negligence to deliberate attempts to conceal financial irregularities. This raises an alarming question as to why no one has taken action or asked questions about the missing audits. This is related to accountability and governance mechanisms of DDC and the government itself. It is crucial for stakeholders, including government authorities, regulatory bodies, and the general public, to demand transparency and seek answers regarding the reasons behind the missing audits. Without regular audits, it becomes difficult to assess financial performance, identify areas for improvement, and ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Lack of transparency in the organization has led to mismanagement, corruption, and resource wastage, further hindering the efficiency of DDC.
To conclude, to enhance efficiency and improve the dairy market in Nepal, it is imperative for the government to adopt effective policies that focus on fostering a thriving milk industry rather than directly engaging in business operations. For instance, one of the major factors contributing to the low milk production in Nepal is the limited milk yield of the local cow breeds. Currently, only 5% of the cattle in Nepal are pure breeds such as Holstein and Jersey, which are known for their higher yield. To address this issue, Nepali farmers have resorted to artificial insemination (AI) to crossbreed their local cattle with Holstein and Jersey breeds. However, despite these efforts, the average milk yield per cow ranges from 500 to 2,000 liters per year, which falls short of desired levels. To tackle these challenges and revitalize the dairy market, the government can facilitate the import of high-yielding dairy cows. By streamlining the process and making it more accessible for businesses and corporations to import such cows, Nepal can significantly boost milk production.
Similarly, encouraging foreign direct investment (FDI) in the dairy sector can yield substantial benefits. For instance, if renowned brands like Amul are allowed to enter Nepal, they can bring advanced technologies, expertise, and cooperative models. It is important to dispel the misconception spread by interest groups that such investment will negatively impact local milk farmers. In reality, international brands will still rely on local farmers for their milk supply. Additionally, the comparative affordability of milk in Nepal compared to neighboring India ensures that Nepali farmers will not suffer from a lack of demand. In fact, increased competition and demand from foreign brands entering the market will incentivize farmers to produce more milk. Hence, the government should prioritize the best interests of the overall population rather than succumbing to pressure from interest groups.
Lastly, the government must take decisive steps to ensure free market competition in the dairy sector and limit its crucial role in standardizing milk quality through the implementation of effective quality control measures. Introducing a free-market framework and fostering healthy competition are essential as they empower the market to self-regulate, eliminating substandard milk products that fall short of meeting consumer demands. In a truly free market, local participants will be driven to standardize their milk products to compete effectively. As a result, only the highest quality milk will prevail in the market, benefiting consumers by guaranteeing their access to safe and nutritious dairy products. Embracing such a market-oriented approach is pivotal for the industry's long-term growth and sustainability, as it encourages innovation, efficiency, and the continual improvement of product offerings. By facilitating an environment where quality is the hallmark, the government can inspire consumer trust, foster economic development, and position Nepal's dairy sector as a beacon of excellence both domestically and internationally.

Universities in Nepal, along with their numerous affiliated colleges in various domains of specialization, have gradually acknowledged and embraced the importance of research as an integral part of their academic practices. After all, research activities enable scholars in any domain of knowledge—sociology, economics, education, engineering, or management—to either examine or explore the relationship between their academic learning and practices, preferences, possibilities, and problems that are emerging in real-world settings. Through research activities, scholars can also acquire essential professional skills like the application of concepts, processes, steps, and theories learned in academia for the analysis of real-world problems, data management, inference, contextualization, and evidence-based interpretations. As a result, educational institutions associated with Nepali higher education regularly organize conferences, seminars, research workshops, and data analysis training sessions to support their scholars and faculty members with publications and participation in different conferences.
However, so much of the research-based knowledge and evidence generated in Nepali academia never gets implemented in practice that there is a huge research-professional practice gap in Nepali higher education. Therefore, it is no surprise that the libraries of universities find it worthless to keep archives of graduate projects, post-graduate theses, and dissertations; hence, after some time, most of them are simply sold off to scrap dealers.
Since university educators, research scholars, and professors observe and analyze professional and social realities from their academic norms and hypotheses, there is a common assumption that academics don’t produce anything useful for society, the economy, or business in practical or applied terms. This assumption is also justified by the fact that in Nepali academic circles, so much of the research activities are framed on the basis of reviews of existing theories, concepts, and published literature, or approaches to research that some professors and faculty members presume to be most reliable and valid. Hence, academic research lacks proper grounding in research problems, contextual knowledge gaps, practices, and selections of factors and issues that are observable and emerging in a real-world setting.
As we can observe in management studies, where thousands of dissertations are completed with reference to the Nepali financial sector, this sector is utterly aloof, disinterested, and indifferent to the knowledge and evidence generated by these research works. After all, just because there is a concept doesn't mean that the problems and practices of commercial banks can be grounded in that conceptual framework; relationships between concepts in theory may not have any relation to practice. For example, work-life balance may be an emerging concept in management, but to most professionals working in the banking sector, the issue of balancing work and life may never occur to their minds in spite of all the hectic schedules, stress, and workloads. Perhaps imbalances between work and life are integral part of the competitive working culture of commercial banks.
Hence, publication for the sake of publication can be a criteria for professor tenure and university ranking, but that is certainly not a concern for any dynamic, competitive, and vibrant organization like a commercial bank. That is why most of the students are not passionate about doing their theses and want to outsource the process or streamline it with every possible shortcut. Even if they publish research in a highly ranked journal, they know it has zero professional or financial value beyond the walls of the university.
More importantly, when academic research occurs within operative closures, where none of the research activities move out of the university system, various malpractices, misuses, and manipulations also begin to emerge, as we see when a senior professor or a dean publishes journal articles with scholars or young lecturers as co-authors, and we don't know who among them has contributed the most to the final research paper or if the names of others have simply been added due to hierarchy or power structure. That is why we can find in Nepal the names of some people hanging behind as co-authors in different research papers, although they don’t themselves have any specializations in that domain of knowledge. Hence, in most cases, academic research only remains a self-maximizing tool for professors, deans and senior lecturers, despite the agony and hard work of young faculty members and scholars.
Moreover, when we analyze this isolated and self-referential aspect of academic research happening in Nepali higher education, we also realize why universities are not developing their students into scientists, engineers, innovators, entrepreneurs, disruptive thinkers, system designers, theorists, and paradigm shifters capable of solving real-life problems and making contributions to the progress of overall society. Our professors and lecturers have only remained artists, admiring their own creations with utter arrogance and self-admiration, whereas most people outside their close system are not interested in their art. As a result of this self-admiring tendency, we observe that different departments of universities keep on producing research dissertations and articles on different events, experiences, and circumstances using the same research methodologies over and over again.
However, to remain competitive, relevant, and vibrant in an international market, universities in Nepal need to undertake research activities that have applied value for scientific, business, industrial, and technological development, where evidence, trends, tendencies and interpretations generated through research have analytical, practical, decision-making, and problem-solving potential for businesses and entrepreneurs. Likewise, universities, rather than operating as a closed system, need to collaborate with stakeholders in higher education through knowledge sharing platforms to ground their research activities in real-world issues and ground-based observations that are pertinent to professionals and decision-makers in public and private institutions so that research findings generated in institutions of higher learning are applicable for expanding and enhancing the quality, sustainability, optimization, efficacy, and effectiveness of professional practices.
More importantly, it is for universities in Nepal to realize that research with scientific, innovative, social, and professional potentials, utility, and relevance not only enhances the perceived value and reputation of Nepali universities and educational institutions of higher education in terms of grants, market outreach, funds, and investment collaborations but also indicates to potential students that universities in Nepal, like foreign academic institutions, are also involved in solving real-life scientific, social, economic, business, and industrial problems.

It appears that the current generation of loving couples getting married in Nepal in an urban context are enchanted and enthralled by the idea of a soulmate. Hence, the idea of someone being your soulmate keeps trending on different social networking sites as an ideal version of being in love together. Although the current generation of loving couples has an idealized image of a soulmate, in reality, for many people, the idea of finding and living with a social mate remains limited to mere appearances—just a tagline posted along with a visual representation of togetherness shared on different social networking sites.
Our everyday idea about the soulmate falls short of its ideals because we rely on imitations of plastic images of love trending in different mediums of pop culture, compare and contrast our possible loving partners with superficial expressions of other loving couples, and also follow the suggestions and guidelines of other people to identify and determine our soulmate. Similarly, we have misguided expectations about a soulmate as someone who brings a sense of security and feelings of comfort, along with the promise of everlasting love, into our lives.
Besides, our criteria for falling in love with another person are such that we give more preference and priority to what the person has, like a bank balance, a green card, a dependent visa, social status, and a handsome or beautiful face, than to who he or she is as a person with inner human qualities such as honesty, trustworthiness, understanding, commitment, and caring.
Many people miss their soulmates because they are so out of touch with their inner lives as individuals that they remain unaware of the person who is carrying the beats of her heart inside his own. Soulmates get married because they are for each other, not for any other reason.
More importantly, without anything as such to connect with, enrich, and nourish a loving relationship together from within, being in love without a soulmate becomes utterly boring, shallow, lost in appearances, and meaningless. Being in love without a soulmate is a tedious struggle of finding one temporary delight after another in the outer world to justify and demonstrate the shallow and soulless love people have for each other.
The idea of each of us having a soulmate was first put forth by Greek philosopher Plato, who in his seminal work Symposium stated that each of us has another half of our own soul in another physical body; hence, as human beings, we have this inner, irresistible yearning for that interconnection with another being that would make us feel undivided and complete, and as long as soulmates remain separated, there will always be an inner sense of lack, as if things are missing out, out of touch, shallow, and incomplete.
Similarly, in Hindu religious tradition, we have the divine union between Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva as Shiva and Shakti expressed in a singular being, Ardhanarishwar; this mythological narrative is a symbolic representation of reunion between soulmates. Indeed, the struggles and sacrifices of Devi Parvati to belong with Lord Shiva indicate that when it comes to a spiritual journey to find a soulmate, it is not about what other people say or what options or preferences you have; to find a soulmate, you must exercise your freedom, follow your inner voice and its determination, and stand strong with your courage. First, you have to connect and stand firm on your true self to find your true lover.
Hence, to get in touch with your soulmate, first of all, you need to listen to the soft whisper reverberating from your heart that gently tells you she may not be the charming person of your dreams, but it feels as if even as strangers, we have already met for thousands of times. There may have been other lovers of youth, beauty, possession, admiration, and passion, but only she can reach deep inside your heart and understand you just the way you are.
Finding your soulmate would be like stumbling onto someone you are surprised to realize has been shaped and carved like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that fit together only with you. With your soulmate, you get that feeling of being at ease within yourself, and there is no need for any other stimulus or incentive apart from each other’s presence to get a sense of interconnection out of this relationship.
Moreover, soulmates are two individuals who have realized that promising romantic love forever is a lie. Falling in love is easy, but the art of remaining committed to each other in love takes many years of practice to perfect. Even when their love is the glue that binds them together, soulmates understand that for their relationship to last, they need to support each other's motivations, interests, and inspirations and find commonalities between them.
Being in love as soulmates means that we are both willing to make struggles and sacrifices for each other because we both realize that our love has the potential to improve, transform, redefine, and make the best out of our lives altogether. Besides, soulmates don’t play the game of pretending to remain at the center of each other’s attention, and they don't want the other person to become the shadow of their expectations, anticipations, and projections.
To conclude, soulmates are two individuals with a sense of shared self that allows them to blend in, support, and sustain each other's beings together. Where there are differences, soulmates supplement and become each other’s inspiration and strength, and where there are similarities, they explore, enhance, and enjoy their mutual interests and passions together. When soulmates sit together and engage in laughter, dialogue, making love, silence, or discussions, they realize that their loving relationship gives their lives a sense of purpose together, which makes them feel complete and inseparable from each other.

Those words from my lovely wife ended our argument in the kitchen last night.
The night before that, a minor difference in opinion had flickered into a tiny spark and by the time Hegel got involved the next day, it had turned into an inferno.
Before we move on, let’s get to know a little about Hegel so it can help us understand where these two loving souls, my wife and I, usually depart and seldom meet again.
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was a German Philosopher and was considered as the most important figures in German philosophy and one of the founding figures of modern Western philosophy. Leaving all the things he’s said aside, the one thing that has struck a chord with me is his theory on “shape of consciousness”. 
Hegel says simply put, we cannot trust the certitude of our sense organs, also called sense-certainty, because that certitude is embroiled in limitations. Add to that, the human consciousness, and language upon which all sense-making is forced. That leaves no room for subjective agency. Our means of understanding our reality are encouraged, sustained, inspired, and tolerated by those sets of very weak and humanistic attributes. We are flawed in our take of our reality because the moment we set our eyes on something, it takes a form of what it means for us. 
Not what it is in its real essence, but what it means to a human mind.
Imagine a botanist, a wood cutter and a CEO of a furniture company taking a walk in a forest. What they see when they look around are trees and nothing but trees. 
In essence what a tree is, in-itself, they will never know. They cannot catch themselves seeing those trees from anywhere else beyond what their human mind lets them see.
The botanist will see the trees in terms of cambiums and apical meristem. 
The woodcutter will see those trees in terms of his livelihood and his children’s tuition.
The CEO will see them in terms of how many desks his company could produce from the wood of those trees.
The tree’s essence, what it is, and why it is what it is, can never find a place of its individuality because the human mind, limited within its Hegelian purview, will eat up that possibility before anything else.
The tree can never be a tree in itself. Instead, it must be a tree for those three people.
Thomas Nagel, one of my other to-go thinkers wrote a paper back in 1974 titled ‘What is it like to be a bat?’ There is no amount of knowledge or information about a bat that can tell us what it feels like to be a bat within the confines of its bat consciousness. 
Its hunger, its love, its breezing along the meandering swoops and its revulsions against other fellow bats--those we shall never know. The best we could do is anthropomorphize it, like we always do in animation movies where animals tend to live up to human aspirations. 
A human mind is incapable of experiencing a bat’s experience and therefore will never know how a bat might feel. There simply is not a way for anyone of us to know. Let’s be totally asserted on that truth.
In the similar manner, a botanist, a woodcutter, and my lovely wife, how’s their experience any more different from the run-down of that bat’s experience we could relate to?
Fundamentally, their personal experience that’s accessible only to them, be it during the stroll in the forest or the grunt in the kitchen, are theirs to have. I can sit here and try to relativize a woodcutter’s coveting or my wife’s annoyances, but that won’t move the dial if their shape of consciousness is absent from my reach. I can never know how she feels if I can’t own her in totality.
And this is where Hegel comes along to enlighten the predicament of the misrepresentations that becomes a foundational springboard in understanding the shape of the other person’s consciousness.
Our minds, our feelings and everything we claim as ours are cusped within the confines of our personal sense-making. Our experiences become relatable only if we can find a medium to universalize it in terms of human graces or grunts.
I don’t know if Hegel can truly do my wife’s dishes or not.
I am positive he will not because he died long before both of us were born.
Nonetheless, Hegel does remind us that in absence of common reference, our words will fail us miserably. 
And when that happens our silence, perhaps, will hold more meaning.

A dear friend that I have known for decades took his life last week leaving behind a wife, two children and many of us who have not been able to claim back our sanity. There are ten thousand unrelenting questions that are hitting hard on us, and they are not easily going away. It’s been an unsettling week for all of us.
When a tragedy like this happens, it doesn’t take place amidst the clamor of reason and resonance.
Instead, a decision like this is made in the retreat of a cool, calm, and collected mind. At least, that’s what Karl Menninger meditates in ‘Man against Himself’, a brilliant psychiatrist who tries to comprehend why an individual wishes to put himself in a harm’s way from which he cannot, except by suicide, escape from his life.
In other words, if for his own unconscious purpose, a man brings about an apparent justification in external reality for self-destruction, then the unconscious purposes are of more significance in understanding the suicide than the apparently simple, inevitable, external circumstance that are observable to the public. For folks like you and me, the laziest and the most reckless way to make sense of someone’s decision is to try to understand his subjective decision from an objective point of view.
What Menninger is saying humbly is this.
What happens out there are particles simply hitting each other and producing a state of affairs that, when viewed from a frog’s point of view or a bird eye-view, are nothing but occasions passing along space and time. However, when we introduce a human mind to that same state of affairs, everything changes. 
Humans carry an unhealthy number of covenants, rules, positivity, and ought-to-be-ness that sometimes are anti-life. It works more against them than for them. 
In essence, what kills a man under such circumstances is not what’s out there in the world but what’s within him. His provisional compass becomes the contingent arbiter, the judge, the jury, and the noose that can take away his life. At least, that’s what happened with my friend, it looks like.
I can only imagine or perhaps not, what must have gone through his mind in those last forlorn moments of despair and disquietude. I will never find out how many sins he thought he had committed when he compared his external world to Bhagavat Geeta that espouses on being a good human being. I will never find out how much short he found himself in the eyes of Hindu Gods and other deities that had, in his last moments, become toxic for him.
Jordan Peterson is a clinical psychiatrist who perhaps is the most articulate man alive on our planet- at least that’s what the New York Times quotes him to be. 
Peterson makes an appeal to all, not to advise another human being on what should or should not be done, simply because you may screw up that person’s life. It doesn’t matter where such guidance comes from. 
Be it from the voice from heaven or from the Apollo of Delphi or from our own Krishna’s chariots from Kurukshetra. Where they come from is irrelevant but what they render to a human mind is absolutely calamitous.
These oracular voices tend to be more harmful and are totally responsible for human suffering. They create a paradigm in men upon which he is constrained to build up his sense of right and wrong. And life, as you all know, is a roller coaster ride, simply because there’s always a chance for us to spill out of that paradigm. 
Our agency, perhaps our only tool to understand the reality may not always square perfectly with Bhagavad Gita’s diatribes against the sins that men are capable of committing. And that is exactly why no one should be damned because none can control the reality of the world. There seems no room for agency in a world of neural impulses, chemical reactions, and bone and muscle movements. Even if we add sensations, perceptions, and feelings we don’t get action, or doing—there is only what happens.
Under such conditions, my friend who perhaps didn’t find his external reality 'squarely checked’ with his internal covenants saw no point in prolonging his life because he must have gotten lost on his way with no structure to guide him through. The virtues that he adhered so deeply had no place in the world he found himself in. The gods were gone.
He must have found himself in that forlorn Nietzschean world where god lived no more.
There were two ways to fix his problem from what I can tell.
First one was to fix the reality which essentially meant to reorganize the particles that was noumenally visible to him so it would evenly square with his virtues. 
The second was to kill the gods so the world would become livable where he could breathe again.
Unfortunately, both options were not available to him. And the one that he did choose, only that made all the difference to him.

With the massive popularity and abundance of spiritual leaders, gurus, religious groups, religious media channels, and self-help publications, the concept of spirituality has become an integral part of our collective psyche. As a result, many people believe that spiritual perspectives, techniques, and exercises can be applied to solve various mental health issues and educational and behavioral problems in modern society and influence people to make healthy lifestyle choices and meaningful life decisions. However, most often, I find this term overused, misused, confused, and even utterly commercialized.
For example, gurus, meditation teachers, mystics, yogic masters, and preachers package their spiritual techniques and craft their presence in such a way that their spiritual teaching resonates as informative, entertaining, alluring, and incentivized for a specific age group, gender, generation, profession, and for people with a specific way of life, attitude, and purchasing power. And these days, spirituality is no longer something that can be obtained without generous contributions; most of the spiritual reliefs available on the market have a price tag stitched around them.
Our familiar assumptions also limit our understanding of spirituality to becoming members of a spiritual sect, listening to spiritual teachers, following their instructions, and reading spiritual books regularly. But to become spiritual, one does not have to join an esoteric cult, put on religious markers, receive the spiritual energy transmission of a guru and his grace, or uncritically digest his outrageous teaching.
Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, observed that, based on our infantile experiences, it is part of human psychology to yearn for a father figure who can guide us through this chaotic, unpredictable, and confusing world. And there are different gurus, mystics, evangelists, and spiritual masters in the spiritual market ready to take up this role as father figures because, as humans, we want to live a meaningful life, find answers to the questions about our being and suffering, and overcome the fear of death. Besides, all of us also have that feeling of being unsatisfied by material comforts, things, and achievements.
As a spiritual person, I am not opposed to anyone following any spiritual teacher; however, as a follower, you must be critical enough to question their self-contradictory and baseless statements, and also, under the guise of spiritual growth, you shouldn’t be exploited, made vulnerable, or demanded to make irrational commitments and actions. We also need to realize that nobody in this world has a truth that doesn’t need to be proved. I have met hundreds of spiritual teachers from different religious traditions, but I never forgot to keep my critical mind open. After all, the word ""spiritual"" comes from a Latin word meaning ""to breathe freely."" As a result, becoming a free spirit—those who dare to challenge traditional beliefs, let go, and celebrate their liberation—is also a part of human spirituality.
As human existence is divided into mind and matter, we need abstract and soulful substances like poetry, ideas, music, art, literature, philosophy, self-inquiry, and reflections to help us find meaning and significance in our outer actions, associations, objectives, and outcomes from our inner perspectives. In other words, to live a meaningful life, we need to find something—music, art, poetry, meditation, philosophy, or writing—that allows us to explore and engage with the outside world while maintaining our inner sense of balance, detachment, calmness, maturity, and acceptance. Hence, spirituality is a search for an equilibrium point that balances our inner and outer lives.
Spirituality awakens to a living reality that is self-sufficient in itself, and nothing can be more spiritual than living in the world, where you find events, occasions, situations, relationships, explorations, and experiences that can take you out of yourself and connect you with everyone and everything around you. We can also recognize our relative insignificance in the universe when we temporarily dissolve our egos. Similarly, spirituality urges us to embrace, adjust to, and enjoy all the recklessness and paradoxes of human life. There are contractions and confusions everywhere, but these paradoxes also make life deep, dynamic, vibrant, improbable, creative, and exciting.
Surely, life is unfair and unpredictable, and as human beings, we have to deal with lots of people, events, occurrences, and outcomes that we don't like. As everything ends, every moment of life we live, touch, love, reflect on, listen to, connect with, and experience is special, specific, unrepeatable, and unparalleled. Hence, the journey of life becomes more spiritually meaningful than its presumed destinations. This is the only life we have; therefore, everything we do, discover, relate to, and create becomes significant and valuable because we will never have another opportunity to relive and restore those fleeting moments of life. After all, nothing can be more spiritual than to breathe in a world already overflowing with life, rhythm, a sense of wonder, beauty, and mystery.
With intensity, depth of engagement, thoughtfulness, and passion, everything from meditation, yoga, and dance to driving, climbing mountains, having conversations, and having a cup of tea becomes a meaning-making process that is also spiritually enriching. Human spirituality is not something separate from our everyday lives. For example, by reading Chekhov, walking around in the woods, writing poetry, teaching, gazing at the stars, playing with my daughter, and learning the guitar, I am able to engage in a meaning-making process and also feel the connectedness of my being with other beings and nature. And there are numerous other ways to celebrate our spirituality in the midst of our daily activities and practices. Hence, spirituality is not the exclusive property of people with certain levels of spiritual awakening, and we do not need their blessings to become spiritual.
More importantly, there is no need to elevate specific spiritual practices and religious rituals above any other ordinary human activities. With a little forethought, emotion engagement, love, passion, depth in involvement, and awareness in every ounce of our fleeting human existence, we can spiritualize our individual lives.

In the age of consumerism, we as individuals are forming our mindsets and behaviors based on what we have learned from different advertisements, social media contents, blog posts, expert opinions, TikTok, celebrity endorsements on Instagram, TV reality shows, the latest viral trends and contents, product positioning, celebrity lifestyles, movies, and so on.
As a result, we are influenced by the suggestions, persuasions, and symbolic meaning we have derived from these sources and develop our taste, preferences, decisions, comparisons, and lifestyle choices accordingly.
Similarly, we also learn so much about loving relationships from the narratives of love symbolized in movies and songs. Likewise, we like to read guidebooks on the art of loving to enhance our love, replicate the love lives of different social media influencers, and make love decisions based on consumer values of use and disposal. When it comes to choosing gifts for your girlfriend, you also seek expert advice and adhere to their guidelines in order to provide her with the ultimate experience of your love.
Just to give an example of this learning because of the influence of pop songs these days, for modern lovers, breakup has simply become a natural or obvious stage of the love cycle,  comparable to any other product life cycle where, after peak experiences of love, there will be decline and discontinuity.
Being in love also becomes useless when excitement begins to weaken and the boredom of repetition starts to creep in, and at that moment, you can ""shake it off,"" as Taylor Swift reminded us; indeed, if you can't make him stay, you can at least shake him off. Breakups aren't tragic, brokenhearted, or sad. Don't waste your emotions grieving over him; save your emotions for someone else you'll find again. Now you are better off being apart than together, as “The Breakup Song” lyrics from ""Ae Dil Hai Mushkil"" remind us, and breakups have become just another reason to reignite your passion, take charge of your life again, and party with friends rather than hang on and grieve over a stale relationship.
Likewise, we feel that exchanging various products developed as gifts and engaging in modern-day love rituals would prolong, strengthen, and enrich our loving relationships. Modern-day love rituals like Rose, Chocolate, and Teddy Days, candlelight dinners, Valentine's Day gift packages, and diamond rings and bracelets make so much sense in consumer culture because the products and services that are available in the market can be used to signify and express a person's quantum of love.
Love has surely become costly. With so many products and services in the consumer market that symbolize and signify different features, dimensions, depths, and expressions of love, lovers need to have sufficient purchasing power to exchange, enjoy, and experience love in all its colors, exuberance, and facets.
From restaurants, vacations, shopping, birthday celebrations, night outs, romantic dates, and weekly gifts to movie theaters, different portions of love hang everywhere, and you need to purchase them to enrich your loving relationships. Indeed, you can consume these products and services with your partner in order to enhance your experience of being in love and make it more satisfying and exciting.
Falling in love in the age of consumerism becomes so irrelevant, less exciting, dull, and meaningless if you can't buy your portion of love.
As a result, much of human love and relationship in this consumer age is nurtured by an individual's consuming capacity and purchasing power rather than genuine passion, sacrifice, a sense of togetherness, trust, support, and tolerance for each other. We have started to view people as commodities that can be exchanged, consumed, and disposed of.
Moreover, falling in love has become some kind of window shopping where we look for different categories of image, expectation, satisfaction, and anticipation in someone to fall in love with, just like we go through a catalog to find a suitable product with essential features, functions, qualities, possibilities, and consumer benefits. As with other products, if it serves our purpose, our relationship will last for years; otherwise, it will be dumped and replaced if it fails to meet our expectations.
Besides, based on our consumer mindset, we think that we can easily dump a person and find a replacement rather than engage in the difficult tasks of acceptance, accommodations, and conflict resolution. After all, a loving relationship is interchangeable from the standpoint of a consumer; thus, like any rational consumer, we are free to dispose of the other person when we are confident enough to realize that we can now possess an upgraded model than what we currently have.
In the age of consumerism, our ways of loving and being in relationships also resemble how we would interact with and react to any other consumer product available on the market. Loving someone is just a part of consumer behavior.
Just as consumers have learned to seek temporary satisfaction—something attractive that immediately makes us happy for a moment—we all have become collectors of transient moments in love. Lovers may post their pictures or reveal their intimate confessions of love to the public in a manner of showing off, but lovers always feel insecure about being disposed of, dropped, or interchanged. And like our affection for any other consumer product, after a while, love also fades away.
Loving relationships have indeed become liquid.

Patan is a historical city situated in Lalitpur District of Nepal, inhabited by the people of Newar community. A remarkable characteristic of this city is its portrayal of religious harmony between Hindus and Buddhists in every aspect of the community. Being born and raised here, I got more and more interested in the city when I started doing my graduate studies in Urban Planning, and the insights have been truly fulfilling.
Sustainable cities are the pressing need of modern times. City planners use tactics such as zoning, open space allocation, walkability, urban growth boundaries, satellite cities and many more to achieve this, but the way in which the then planners of Patan achieved this is truly worth learning.
Let me take you through Patan in the 17th century. To start with, “Astamatrika”, the eight mother goddesses, and “Dashamahavidya”, the 10 goddesses, were established to set the boundary for urban expansion. The faith in these places of worship was such that people did not go beyond the perimeter set by the goddesses. This protected the lower fertile agricultural land, while the higher ground was used for settlement. So the perimeter boundary directed the development to be compact, and thus walkable. However, though there was compactness, there were ample urban open spaces and lung spaces (green spaces). Urban open spaces named “Lachi”, “Nani”, “Bahal” & “Bahi” were preserved and each was tied with its respective religious belief system (Hinduism or Buddhism), such that no one encroached upon it (unlike our open spaces!). For lung spaces named “khyo”, different festivals and socio-cultural events were planned such that the space would be in constant care. Also, open spaces of ecological importance were tied with various rituals too. The planners then had the vision and the creative methods to protect these open spaces.

Moving further into the city, the form of residential quarters shows the importance given to communal living. The houses are clustered around an inner courtyard, giving room for private spaces inside houses, while ensuring access to a larger public space for everyone. This model with slight deviations is becoming popular with Western developers too.

Newa Chen, a 17th-century building, renovated in 2006 with help from UNESCO

In the case of zoning, it was “zoning by jaat” or “zoning by profession”. Though the concept of “jaat” led to social discrimination, in those days it was primarily used to create “homogeneous communities by occupation” to create agglomeration and economies of scale. With all this in place, when the population still exceeded a certain limit, a satellite town was established with linkages to the main town, to curb the effects of overpopulation.
So this begs the question, how was this extraordinary feat made possible? Certainly, the planners were quite creative and the tool they used was ritual mediation. The meanings given by the people to these rituals had bound the people. They put tremendous faith in rituals and religion. But now, as with every historic city, Patan is going through the process of degeneration. At times the rituals can be seen to be performed only for the sake of rituals, without paying enough attention to the deeper purpose of sustainability, which they hoped to achieve. This situation has brought forth a new set of challenges, which calls for maximum creative efforts by planners to establish newer meanings. An example could be, the lung spaces mentioned earlier being protected through socio-cultural events might be adjusted by giving access to schools for their events in culture and sports, in case the previous ties grow weaker.
History serves as a record of experiences and learning, but not as a rule book. It is up to us to learn from the experiences of the past, and come up with creative solutions to tackle the challenges of the present and future.
May the planners of the future write as highly of us as we write about the planners of the past.

In a very odd manner, every possible world tends to exist in ways that are not entirely physical. A world that could be described in words but is devoid of any space-time convergence. Our dreams, for example, don't have any physical run-down. They just appear real to the dreamer and yet leave in a wisp when they are over. The dreamer then is left with the memory of the world that never gets to come alive, the world of zero substance, and the world whose absence is the very reason that gives meaning to the world that gets to live forward.
The nonappearance of every possible version of our other realities makes it possible for this reality to emanate into the physical world that matters to us the most. This is where we find ourselves. This is the one that has its claim on us. Think about the person you didn’t marry, the child that wasn’t born to you, the winter that failed to bring the snow and the friendship that couldn’t find its morning in the dew of little things and didn’t get refreshed.
In that sense, all that didn’t happen in a life is the very life blood of what did happen in a very bizarre and asymmetrical manner. The relationship between those two worlds is just the fringe line that makes those two worlds mutually coeval. Not just the one that claims me but also the one that I am absent from. 
This is the world that I ponder about all the time. This is also where I find myself present in my absence. 
Those two roads that diverged in the woods and the one Robert Frost didn’t take, 
What happened to that road? 
Did it wither away? 
Or did it somehow become a critical part of the one that was taken? Frost’s grievance about the road not taken makes one wonder what the real loss to him was. 
The road that he didn’t take is as necessary as the one he did take. 
For if it were not for the one untaken, the taken would lose its significance. 
However, unlike Robert Frost, there are moments in life where two roads don’t always diverge into the yellow wood. In fact, I only see one road ahead of me. And this one doesn’t lead to the yellow wood. Instead, it leads to this huge strip of a green hill. In the midst of that hill, there’s a big oak tree. Under it, I see a man waiting for something, or perhaps someone. I don’t know.
So, I hesitate for a moment, but then I move toward him to get closer.
The story of his life is the story of anyone’s life. He has had his share of life’s ups and downs in this world that claims him in all its hue and tinge. The man’s loss of his love, his aspirations, his honor, his will, and all that makes him the hero of his device, all that is taken away. 
This is the man who doesn’t look straight at me. I cannot clearly see him.
His voice grooved and barely audible, as if he is telling the story of his life to himself. My presence doesn't seem to bother him. He is speaking very softly, and he is speaking of the life he missed to be a part of. This life, the one under the oak, isn’t his for him. He is a stranger here.
The life, he thinks, belongs to him is in the negative space. It is the space that can only be imagined or dreamed of. This is where he finds his completions. 
His love, his honor, his aspirations, and everything that makes him a whole, it happens in this imagined space.
This is his home, the one built on his absences.
Nonetheless, he seems not to understand that both these worlds, the one under the oak tree and the one away from it are his to claim.
One subdued in the background while the other bulged out into physical space. 
Both these two realms are necessary for this forlorn man to become a whole.
Take away one and the other ceases to live. 
I look at him again, and this time, he looks right back at me.
The man slowly moves as if to talk to me. He leans forward.
Now, I see his face in my deepest awe. I know this man! 
This is the man from that hill. The man from under the oak tree.
I recognize him now. This man is me. 
I am the man under that oak tree.

I can understand when philosopher Slavoj Zizek sees happiness as unethical. For many of us happiness seekers, his assertion may sound rather surprising. However, I think Zizek is right with his claim, if our appetite for maximizing our happiness now impacts ecological collapse, puts the existence of future generations on this planet at a greater risk and also compromises the ability of the future generations to meet their needs without strife and needless sufferings. Besides, in an age of hyperconsumerism, we have placed our habits of happiness on a shallow myth that we can’t be happy without having. And, we have mindlessly decided to overlook the bitter truth that many of our happiness choices are detrimental to the ecology and sustainability. Similarly, our search for happiness can be unethical if we stifle and undermine the happiness of others for our selfish fulfillments. We see this in our family life, where most parents add needless sorrows in the lives of their children for not keeping up with their choices, expectations and preferences.
My own search for happiness reminds me that the road I am traveling on is full of potholes. And, by traveling on this bumpy road, I have realized that happiness always appears in our life in unusual shapes, sounds and sizes. Hence, there are little puddles of humor, fun, playfulness and joys everywhere. Moreover, in my search for happiness, I have unearthed some essential ingredients for a happy life.
To live a happy life, firstly, we need to respect and admire others for their unique ways of being in the world. Some like to make noise, others crave silence, and some like to be in front and others like to shout from the back. Hence, rather than comparing people, we need to admire people for who they are, what they have been through and how they like to engage with other people. With this respect we can both increase and improve our human relationships, the way we relate to each other, which is essential for a happy life.
The next ingredient for a happy life is that we need to have enough courage so that we can avoid becoming a chasing shadow of other people’s expectations, projections and desires. Without courage, our life would be nothing more than a tedious circle of compulsions and compromises. And, it also takes enormous courage to be satisfied with who we are and what we have right now.
Finally, so much of our happiness depends on our ability to let go of our sense of control. In a world of imperfections, how our life unfolds and how people decide to act and react with us are beyond our absolute control. Hence, rather than holding onto the ropes of our expectations tightly, we need to let go and enjoy what remains of it, the experience of life, with all its random surprises - and that’s what happiness is.
Sources of Happiness
The most important source of happiness in our life is not what we have with us or what we want to have sooner or later, rather, streams of happiness begin to sprout in our life abundantly when we begin to realize that our human life is indeed little and we can’t go on postponing our happiness by attaching it to some event, situation or to an achievement that we may never encounter in our short life. None of us have a written script of our life with us and as we strive toward our dreams and possibilities, often the drama of life turns out the way we never suspected.
And, to find happiness in those messy and confusing moments of our life we need to recognize that patterns of human life are unwritten, uncalled for and unpredictable. Even with our utmost preparedness none of us can systematically dictate the course of our life with our own will. Therefore, in order to live a happy life we need to replace the concept of happiness as a destination with the concept of happiness as a process. After all, so much of the happiness we experience in our life depends on how we react to what is happening in and around us.
Most of us are unhappy because we think of happiness in terms of when or how we are going to be happy. Whereas we can create happiness even in difficult situations of our life by remaining resolute in our inner conviction that with whatever we have we can always recreate our life once again. Besides, when we have nothing else to do, even counting what we already have also makes us happy. Despite having many things, many of us are miserable with a single thought of why we don’t have with us what the rest of the world already has.
Having is not enough; happiness happens when we do something that makes us feel worthwhile, energetic, focused, connected, purposeful and engaged. For example, we can learn new stuff, develop new habits, cultivate new friends, make life easy for ourselves, let go of expectations that pull us down and sometimes take a step back to see things anew. Moreover, life is not fair and all of us don’t need equal things to be equally happy. Our struggles also give us a sense of happiness when we realize that we are maturing as a human being climbing new heights.
Finally, I feel that the most precious source of happiness is always cheap, ordinary, plentiful, spontaneous and free. Just the other day, I was witnessing clouds in the sky, which seemed like building tiny steps into eternity, and these clouds floating in the sky made me feel relaxed and fulfilled for a while. I know there is nothing special about clouds playing in the sky. However, all we get in life are the moments to become happy and it depends on how we add these moments  to our experiences and make our life a satisfying journey.
Happiness: A Journey
Whenever I ponder over my quest for a flourishing life, I take the words of poet T.S. Elliot rather seriously as he has written somewhere in one of his poems that, we shall not cease from exploration/and the end of all our exploring/we will arrive where we started and know the place for the first time. In essence, our search for happiness begins with oneself and culminates within oneself. However, in a world of constant distractions, denials, self-deceptions and delusions, for most of us it is rather discomforting to be at ease, comfort or at peace with oneself.
After witnessing and experiencing various ups and downs in our life and facing up to all the troubles and sorrows that life throws at us from time to time, our search for happiness turns full circle when we realize that the ultimate joy in our life begins to overflow profoundly when we become true to ourselves standing before the mirror of our life, embracing its true reflections and finding freedom within our self. But, the paradox here is that only those who know how to spread out their self find happiness within them. Hence, in our search for happiness we also realize that happiness is not something we experience in isolation and that we derive most of our happiness by connecting with people around us.
Moreover, the journey of life takes its own turn and we also need to adopt, adjust and add a sense of growth and maturity with our age as various phases of our life have their own peculiar sources of joy for us to rediscover. Here, for many people their search for happiness becomes delusional, self-destructive and indulgent, when they fail to comprehend this reality of human life. Hence, to experience happiness at different junctures, we need to rephrase and reshape our dreams, hopes, wishes, relationships and expectations, adopting the emerging realities of our life. Besides, as long as we are pursuing happiness, our search becomes like running about from one circle to another trying to find something that exists like a mirage appearing in the dry wilderness; it appears at once and escapes in another moment. And, while journeying on rough and tough roads of our life in search of happiness, often we need to take a pause and shift our mind from the loops of desiring and expecting to life itself where everything is alive and happening.
Lastly, rather than finding, happiness is just about letting go and losing oneself in the moment with whatever ordinary we have, a piece of music, art, dance, reflection, love, friendship, conversation, meditation , sex, fun or poetry. After all, happiness is always with us, it simply needs a bit of inner tuning and with our sense of ease, acceptance and comfort within oneself, we can catch its vibrations all around us echoing.

Rabindra Mishra’s new alliance with the Rashtriya Prajatantra Party, virtually a political arm of the former king, has hogged much of the limelight in recent days. The comfort with which he has gelled with his new companions indicates that Mishra is much more at ease under the former king’s patronage than he ever was during his brief, if half-hearted, stint as a republican with the Bibeksheel Sajha Party. The palpable ease with which he has hugged the institution of monarchy shows that he has finally sloughed off his outer skin and has decided to openly and unequivocally put the money where his mouth is. In deciding to abandon his previous niceties–both in his ideology as well as his speech–Mishra has replaced his finger wagging schoolmarmish style, with a metaphorical sledge-hammer and has decided to wield it against the nascent democracy questioning its very foundations.
It is no wonder that Mishra has tapped into a powerful mix of grievances and resentment of the old guard, those who typically were the beneficiaries of–and did well under–the former king’s and his predecessor’s patronage. If the “likes” and “retweets” on Twitter are any indication, even those who claim to be a “Global Citizen from Gulmi” seem to be tacitly endorsing a patently parochial view based on medieval superstitions.
That a child born in a certain family inherently holds a superior position to the rest of us and accordingly has an in-born right to rule as an “enlightened guardian”–something that Mishra is advocating for–is a notion that would invoke laughter and ridicule if it was not so dangerous and foolish.
Now, to his credit, I think Mishra is indirectly and unwittingly serving democracy by holding the banner of opposition against, among other things, the cronyism and kleptocracy of our current leaders. The current crop of leaders are indeed undermining Nepal’s fledgling democracy by their own incompetence and widespread grift. Our democratic institutions, unfortunately, have not matured enough to curb the excesses of our leaders and a sensible conservatism, I believe, does have an important role to play in the current political climate.
However, by advocating for the resurrection of a dated institution that has been the provenance of bigotry, arbitrary hierarchy, and authoritarian policies in the past, Mishra is doing nothing more than expressing his frustration against the radical leveling of human dignity that has followed the Maoist Revolution in Nepal.
For all its chaos and cravenness, there is no denying that the Maoist revolution initiated an era of modernity that valued the minorities and indigenous people as human beings with their own individuality and human dignity, something that was denied to them for centuries under the structural discriminations created and sustained under various monarchical regimes.
Mishra’s belief that a “soft dictator” should always hover over the heads of Nepali people–ready to unleash the punitive power of the state at its will–not only belies ignorance of human psychology and its cravings for unlimited power, but, more importantly, is indicative of a limited historical understanding of how democracy functions and delivers.
Democracy, though a rule of the majority, ensures fundamental freedoms and protects the rights of the minorities. It is an inherently messy system which by default favors wheeling and dealing among various political actors instead of dealing in quick fixes along clean and defined lines. Unfortunately the bad tags along with the good in a democracy, and it is one of the vital duties of a politician to see that the good comes out on top. However, men are not angels and therefore democracy requires institutional maturity and independence to hold the political actors accountable whenever they cross the legal and normative boundaries. And those boundaries are set not only by courts and government agencies but also by the society at large. An intelligent politician more attuned to the aspirations of modern times would try to align our Byzantine institutions–the actual root of our current problem–with the promises enshrined in our current Constitution, however lacking those may be. It is no doubt easier said than done; however, a great leader knows that not everything can be achieved in one’s lifetime. A good leader knows that our present should not define our future because politics at heart is about what ought to be rather than what is.
Instead Mishra has decided to provoke the latent elements in our society that are atavistic, backward, and superstitious. By surrendering his conscience at the altar of His Highness, Mishra, I believe, is doing a disservice to the ideology of conservatism itself. In his interviews he regularly waxes nostalgic about what we have lost as a culture and community, but rarely does he acknowledge what we have gained as a nation. The laundry list of his complaints are long and consist mainly of the natural consequences that result when a society long held on a chokehold of arbitrary power breaks free. The Nepali people have freed themselves from an arbitrary power that could snatch our freedom at will. We have laid the groundwork for a positive, scientific, and a forward looking country where the minorities and the indigenous have an equal ownership in the nation. It would be a significant backward step to take that away from the people and hand it over to a hereditary power that could potentially pull the plug on our democracy on its whim. Are we really up for that?

What does the future of humanity look like? Machine learning and artificial intelligence are pushing all kinds of business, innovation, research and other areas to a whole new level, especially in developed countries. The time has come for Nepal to embrace the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence to tackle the difficult problems that the country has faced for centuries. Natural disasters, precision agriculture, managing road traffic, environmental sustainability are the perfect candidates for the next technological revolutions.
As a middle school student in America, I have had the privilege of learning programming and machine learning along with theoretical foundations from experts in the field. I invite the girls of Nepal to join me in learning the foundations of data science and machine learning so that we not only help the country to grow with a future army of machine learning experts, but also smooth out the wrinkles of the gender gap in Nepal. It is obvious that one of the most significant steps toward breaking the gender barrier is through empowering girls. Let's make it happen!
Your future is powered by code; if you want to build for the future, you'll need to learn how to code. Here, I propose an innovative idea about the most sophisticated tool that is transforming the world right now. I invite the girls of Nepal to join me in learning how to code for predictive analytics and machine learning. My purpose for this call is twofold: first, to contribute to reducing the gender gap, and second, to have fun teaching coding and machine learning.
Coding, or computer programming, is a vital tool in science, engineering, business and many other fields that will help you tremendously in achieving your goals. Coding is the language of machine learning and predictive analytics. The developed countries of the world are undergoing a major transformation in their economies thanks to the very powerful algorithms of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). But how does it work?
Machine learning is a futuristic idea that has been in the making for quite some time now. It is a set of algorithms that predicts patterns and data on a large scale. Machines are learning how to process vast amounts of data in order to improve our lives in ways we can't even fathom. Machine learning is a set of computer algorithms that learn how to make predictions based on the information provided. With human intelligence, it is difficult to make predictions with datasets that are too large, complex, or vast. In contrast, machines will be able to take the data and make the predictions that humans cannot.
Take an example of AlphaGo with which began the global sensation of AI. Designed in 2015, AlphaGo, an AI with unimaginable power, won against the best of the best in the game of Go. The best part is, the designer of AlphaGo has no clue how to play the game.
Whereas AlphaGo is an example of a full-blown powerful AI, what I am proposing here is the route to becoming a specialist in various types of predictive analytics and machine learning. Conventionally, AI has been treated as a broad spectrum of techniques that solve a computational task. This can theoretically include many techniques, many of them being not-so-great historically. Machine learning is a suite of powerful statistical models and algorithms that have developed dramatically in these last few decades. These days, when the media talks about AI, they usually refer to a specific version of the ML models called deep learning or its variants.
Machine learning is a remarkable set of technologies that can be used for a wide variety of applications. One of the algorithms I’ve written is 97% accurate in detecting breast cancer. For this, I used a database of over 11,000 medical records published online. The model I wrote learns to distinguish a case of breast cancer from a healthy breast by comparing many characteristics of breasts afflicted with cancer versus the ones without. Machine learning is the foundation of the future of healthcare. Experts believe that half of the medical discoveries and innovations will come from machine learning in a decade, as opposed to the current heavy reliance on hard-core scientific research as of now.
Machine learning algorithms are used for many kinds of applications such as in healthcare, email filtering, speech recognition, computer vision, search engine queries, and many more. The question is, can we create an army of ML experts in Nepal and make a dent in the gender gap with the proper training and mindset?
Machine learning, specifically AI driven by the architecture of deep learning model, is transforming the industries of the developed world. Whereas all these achievements sound far-fetched, especially in a developing country like Nepal, they were all achieved with the application of powerful algorithms. For that, all you need is a passion to learn how to code and to learn the theory. I am myself learning machine learning, and have already been able to use some of the machine learning models I have programmed in various predictions. It gives me pleasure when I can teach what I have learnt and help reduce the gender gap at the same time. If you are curious about coding, data engineering and machine learning, join me online in gaining this new knowledge.
In this programming and machine learning course, I will walk you through the basics of programming. This foundational material about scripting is the first step in programming of any type of analytics. And this is going to enrich you with a whole new suite of scripts to perform many essential tasks in analytics. The skills in foundational programming will also come handy when you want to solve many kinds of real-world problems. For example, I like to program and solve problems that come up in college-level probability courses. I am able to do this via programming even when I don’t understand the math.
I have created a few articles showing several of these problems, their code, and solutions. For example, roll several dice at the same time and if you observe the same number in more than one dice repeatedly, those outcomes can be simulated with the code I published here. In another article here, I show how the chances of two students in a group of 25 having the birthday on the same day are actually pretty high. I have also published my code here to find the probabilities of various kinds of card games. In addition, I simulated the famed Monty Hall Problem to solve the puzzling question as to which choice would help you win the game. The simulation of the situation [available at my GitHub] revealed that the answer was not what I had thought.
Whereas you can do many types of problem-solving with the basics of programming like I showed above, the main goal of this first course is to get ready for machine learning. Once the basics of programming are completed, I will walk you through several models of machine learning. If you are interested, sign up today for this free course. All you need is a computer, and the desire to learn!

I come from the Chepang community, one of the most backward communities in Nepal and categorized as a highly marginalized community by the National Federation for Development of Indigenous Nationalities (NFDIN). As I belong to and grew up in this community, it motivated me to write a reflective piece on the contributions of education and the bottlenecks for the Chepang community in the current educational pedagogy in Nepal.
The Chepang community falls behind in different socioeconomic indicators such as literacy and access to health and basic infrastructure, as well as in different socioeconomic categorizations. Despite support from several NGOs, INGOs and constant support from the government, the Chepang community continues to remain in a dire situation. There were several non-formal education programs conducted by NGOs which have enabled target groups to become aware so that they can help themselves. Despite the continuous flow of aid, however, the desired socio-economic transformation has not been seen in the Chepang community. This gives ample supporting statement on why there has been less development in the Chepang community. Literacy rate is still low, most of them still live below the poverty line, and they are far behind in the human development index and similar indicators. There are indigenous communities who made a leap in income-generating activities, adult literacy programs, and other development activities. Chepang people, however, still lag behind on all fronts.
Every year thousands of students complete SEE, higher secondary education or bachelor’s degree out of whom few are from the Chepang community. Despite structural and historical disadvantages, a few Chepangs excel in their academic career. Even after Chepangs are able to complete their education in spite of several hardships, they need to compete with others for Public Service Commission, non-governmental, skills-based and other jobs. Those who are able to receive good schooling are at least exposed to multiple facilities including access to computer learning, libraries and sports, and so might have enriched their general knowledge and have a competitive advantage when applying for jobs. But the ones like students from the Chepang community who mostly complete school from a place where there are limited facilities, exposure and training, find it difficult to compete with the batch of students with whom they pass SEE or high school together. Lack of basic computer skills, training and exposure puts them at a disadvantage in the application process. However, there are a few exceptions where a student who completed schooling from a remote part of the country competed and excelled in many aspects. This gives ample space to reflect on what is holding the Chepang community back – whether it is the current pedagogy or the incompetency within students from the Chepang community.

Education as a means to reproduce inequality for Chepang community
It is clearly seen in Nepal that those who can afford expensive tuition fees, mostly those from economically well-off backgrounds, tend to send their children to private schools, colleges and universities because they think that expensive schools provide quality education.
When selecting schools and colleges for their children, parents with fat wallets in Nepal take into account the infrastructure of the institution, well-decorated classrooms, transportation, computer labs, swimming pools, basketball courts, football grounds and other facilities. These parents believe that quality education is provided by such schools with proper infrastructure and other facilities. Although it might be a subjective measurement for quality education as indicators, this will make a substantial impact on what students will learn in what environment. Though these may not be good indicators for measurement, what students will learn and how they will learn will certainly make an impact on the overall learning process. And yes, it is certain that students from better economic backgrounds can afford private tutors and attend private schools. Several studies have also found out the positive relations between students’ economic backgrounds and their test scores. These components contribute to differential academic performance in schools which is directly related to the income of a student’s family.
The Chepangs, most of whom come from a poor and downtrodden socioeconomic background, cannot generally attend expensive schools unless they are provided scholarships, subsidies and other benefits. So, students from affluent families go to well-off schools while those from poor economic background attend economic schools. These are the initial indicators for students leading to learning disparities that reinforce social inequality. These substantiate that schools provide competitive learning environments to advantaged children compared to disadvantaged children where schools reproduce or exacerbate some inequalities.
To illustrate with a real-life example, I asked my sister Simran Praja (name changed) who is waiting for her grade 12 results. She is not familiar with what a CV or resume is. She also does not have computer knowledge and skills which are a prerequisite in today’s job market. Basic email communication, searching for jobs, applying for jobs and getting shortlisted is a tall order. There are only a handful of Chepang representatives in government services. Hence, preparing for Public Service Commission jobs is also a difficult task although it’s not impossible.
Hence, these real-life examples clearly show the challenges faced by Chepang students even after they manage to complete basic schooling, high school and even university education. The quality of education that Chepang students are getting is leading them nowhere. A research on Chepangs in 2011 found out that Chepangs had more access to education than before, but the quality of education that Chepang students were receiving was below average. Though a growing number of students were enrolled in schools, children were now just going through the rituals of schooling rather than learning and preparing for their secure future.

Educational journey stymies Chepang’s development
Reflecting on my personal experience of growing up in a Chepang community where there is material deprivation, lack of fulfillment of basic needs and other necessities further deprives the Chepang students of a learning environment. Several studies claim that material deprivation also leads to low educational achievement in schools as students coming from low economic strata tend to lack education materials, environment and parental guidance throughout. To illustrate with an example, poverty plays a crucial role in Chepang children dropping out of school. Some may not be able to afford an education while some drop out in the middle due to household responsibilities. To support the claim one study states that cultural factors play a significant role in Chepang girls dropping out of school as Chepang people expect girls to help their families with household chores, leaving many girls at home during the harvest season and festivals when their families need their help. The author claims that many girls do not attend classes on a regular basis because of household duties such as cutting grass for animals, cooking food, cleaning and taking care of younger siblings.
Even during the recent COVID crisis in Nepal, several students from poor economic backgrounds could not afford to purchase phones and internet data packs which hampered their class attendance. As a result, they could not attend online classes in schools, ultimately leading to many school dropouts in the last two years. Most of the school-going children from the Chepang community had to discontinue their education during the pandemic for lack of internet access, technology and devices, resulting in a large number of dropouts.
These reflections and arguments are also backed up by contributions in sociology by scholars such as Luis Althusur, Downey and Condron who claim that education acts as a means for reproduction of ruling class ideology where dominant class ideology is taught. The scholarly claims that schools act as engines of inequality dominate contemporary sociology of education even though schools play little role in generating achievement gaps. These educational institutions act as a social sorting machine, creating categories that serve as the foundation of later life inequalities. These categories contribute to production of inequalities within schools and beyond.
Way forward for Chepangs: Technical education as a ray of hope
Development agencies still tend to impose their own agenda rather than fulfilling the requirements of Chepangs. Some of the common instances are awareness activities such as financial frugality, use of contraceptives, use of pit latrine, growing cash crops, forming mothers groups, training on tailoring, youth clubs, and ability to sign one’s name. Where is the indigenous knowledge and the prior knowledge that the Chepang community possesses? Why did income-based learning not become a priority for this vulnerable and poor community? Technical and vocational education is gradually gaining popularity in the Chepang community. Technical certified jobs like staff nurse, overseer, electrician, plumber, health assistant are now becoming a way forward for the Chepang community. There are growing numbers of staff nurses who are already in local level health posts on government contracts. These small steps also play a key role in helping the Chepang community support their families, siblings in accessing education and other opportunities.
As most of the Chepang people are below the poverty line, the government needs to give priority to creating more employment opportunities so that everyone can get work. Given that a majority of youths from the community are less educated and have dropped out halfway through school, the country needs to train and mobilize them in the development process. Productivity-focused training skills, recognizing prior learning of Chepangs should be imparted with inclusive targeting to the Chepang community which can provide access to work. This entire process not only helps the country’s economy to grow but also enables the Chepang youths to earn their livelihoods.

As I sit by my ailing father, I have an impression of him representing an era of slowly vanishing Limbu culture and tradition of Mundhum-based rites and rituals.
I still vividly remember how vehemently he performed the ritual of Tongsing Takma as a Yeba (Limbu shaman assigned for carrying out various rituals) some decades ago. In the night of the ritual performance, he would wear long white robe tightened at the waist, a headdress decorated with the feathers of different birds and garlands made from the beads of rudraksha. For the whole night, he would recite Mundhum and dance around the bamboo pole known as Yagesing fixed for the ritual in the middle of the courtyard. As a boy, I could hardly grasp the eloquence of his Mundhum recitation and message of those rich oral scriptures. For me, the event was simply an occasion of celebration and fun where I enjoyed ludicrously following and copying his dancing steps and panicked and thrilled being chased by him in the middle of the ritual performance along with others.
Back then, Limbu community operated differently. They observed their own distinct life rituals including Tongsing Takma. The night of Tongsing Takma was not only an event for ritual performance but it was also a social gathering for the entire villagers. Some of them would come to join hands for the different responsibilities including feeding Tongba (millet beer served in a wooden barrel shaped vessel) and other local liquor to the visitors while others would come to know their fortune from the words of the Yeba, my father. Others joined the Yeba and his Yagapsiba (assistant of the Yeba) in the ritual dance carrying and beating brass plates. For majority of villagers, it was a pure form of an entertainment free of invitation. Everyone was welcomed in the night of the Tongsing Takma ritual.
The decade of 1990 ushered prodigious changes in Nepali politics as well as in sociocultural realms. The Janaandolan of 1990 saw an end of absolute monarchy replaced by constitutional monarchy and multiparty system ending three decades of party-less Panchayat system imposed by King Mahendra in 1960. The same decade also worked as a harbinger for the country embracing neoliberal ideals as the panacea for socio-economical transformation. Nobody thought of far-reaching implications of the incipient systems to the local language, culture, knowledge system and social structures of the indigenous people.
Same applied to the Limbu people, chiefly inhabiting the eastern part of Nepal.  In addition to joining British and Indian armies as Lahure, many Limbu youths followed the footsteps of other Nepali migrant workers making destinations mainly to Malaysia and the Gulf Cooperative Council countries including Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait among others. As foreign employment became a major source of income for many a Nepali households in the last three decades, it further provided an impetus for people to migrate from the hills and mountains to the plain regions of Tarai and from rural villages to city and towns, thus bringing unprecedented changes in rubrics of society and culture.
Such migration trends not only resulted in the shortage of working age people in the villages but also brought changes in demographic and economic structures of towns and countryside leaving the family members of migrant workers increasingly dependent on the remittance they send from abroad. Accordingly, people fell under the charm of consumerism ultimately debilitating the bonds of social relationship and cultural convictions of the indigenous people. As everybody seemed lost in the reservoirs of containment by hailing the contribution of Nepali migrant workers to the economic development of Nepal, nobody seemed cognizant of the disconcerting side of the coin, the breakdown in the family structures and cultural mosaics. The void was not only created in the local labor markets, but also in the urgency of indigenous cultural behaviors and ritual practices.
In the past, my father used to remain busy throughout the year serving the village households as Yeba, performing different rituals of Limbu community like Sappok Chomen (ritual for womb worshipping prior to birth), Mangenna (ritual for good health, peace and progress), Mekkhim (ritual for marriage ceremony) etc. Due to his engagement in such activities of the community, I sometimes used to hear him complaining about not having time for his own household chores as a farmer. But he readily served the community on such occasions. I still remember how my father used to take pride in his narratives of being kidnapped by a supernatural wild shaman in his childhood who taught him the sacred knowledge of Mundhum and turned himself a self learnt Yeba, as one of the chosen persons by the God to save Limbu community from the various misfortunes and sickness. Gradually, my father and fellow Limbu shamans commonly called as Phedangma, Samba, Yeba and Yuma not only found their roles being drastically limited within the community, but they also failed to pass their knowledge to the next generation.
Hermeneutics of Tongsing Mundhum
According to Mundhum scholar Bairagi Kaila, Tongsing Mundhum is an extreme expression of social, ethical and religious beliefs of Limbu people. He writes in Tongsing Takma Mundhum: Aakhyan Ra Anusthan (Tongsing Takma Mundhum: Narratives and Rituals) that Tongsing Mundhum is a quintessential collection of oral literature and ethnic narratives that have been transferred orally from the time immemorial to the Limbu people. This Mundhum is recited and narrated along with music of brass plates and drums by Limbu shamans known as Samba, Yeba, and Yema during the performances of Tongsing Takma ritual. It is believed that Tongsing Mundhum was originated long before the art of writing was introduced.
According to scholar Chaintanya Subba, various myths, legends, narratives and oracles have been incorporated in Tongsing Mundhum which guide the social, ethical and religious concepts and shape the attitude and behavior of the Limbus. It consists of the various myths related to the origin of universe, human beings, plants and animals, and birth of the concepts of incest, jealousy, curse etc. in human society and the remedies for different problems in the society.
Limbus believe that there have been substantial influences of the Tongsing Mundhum in the customs, ideologies, moral values and life rituals of the Limbu community. It has a distinct pragmatic and instructional value with regards to the construction and continuation of various social practices and belief system in the Limbu community. It has played a crucial role in imparting the message of social solidarity and cooperation. However, there remains an effectual task for us to explore the social dimensions of Tongsing Takma ritual impacting the social life and practices of Limbus in the past.
Modernization has resulted into an irreversible loss of Limbu cultural heritages and ritual practices. A handful of enthusiasts of Limbu community are in disagreement themselves on which terminology best describes Limbu religion and cultural landscapes. Each group claims its own validity over the other but ironically overlooks the urgency of passing the knowledge to the coming generation. They don’t realize that culture and rituals live in society, not in institutions and books. If such cultural values can not be transferred to the coming generation, they would be the matter of history, to be searched in anthologies and museums. We certainly do not want that. So, rather than castigating others, we need to explore the nostrums to address the present challenges.
As the majority of young generation are detached from such ritual practices, an irreparable cultural void is being created every day. Incipient danger is that present generation could be the last generation of Limbu community practicing and living with the distinct cultural practices and Mundhum-based life rituals. As remaining Phedangma, Samba, Yeba and Yuma have failed to transfer their knowledge to the young generation, it would be very hard to find their disciples practicing these rituals through the oral recitation of Mundhum after one or two decades. Don’t get me wrong. I don’t want this to happen either. But I have not seen any other possibility too until we carry the torch of responsibility to stand as bulwarks to protect and preserve our distinctive cultural traits before they are pushed into oblivion by the varieties of intrusions.
Today, Tongsing Takma and other rituals have become rare events in Limbu community due to two main reasons: first, very few Limbu Phedangma, Samba, Yeba, and Yema are left in the community who can perform them in a proper way and second, young generation have no inclination to follow these rituals as they are gradually losing interest in the past ideals. This is not simply the fault of young generation living under the overwhelming fluctuations of information and technology. We must take responsibility for not infusing them cultural consciousness and not persuading them to adopt these value systems in everyday life.
Nowadays, a very few households are conducting Tongsing Takma and other rituals as a part of their daily lives mostly in remote villages. Some enthusiastic individuals and institutions are conducting this ritual in Kathmandu and other towns too. But such events largely become a simulacrum of the real Tongsing Takma, more as a frail attempt to recreate it and less as a distinct life rituals of the Limbu community. Such formalized occasions cannot persuade the heuristic value of these rituals to the coming generations.
The only positive sign in this area is there have been some works in the transcribing the oral scriptures of Mundhum recited by those Limbu shamans. In recent days, some Limbu scholars and writers have transcribed Mundhum in Limbu and Nepali language and have documented those ritual performances. In this direction, the colossus work of Mundhum expert Bairagi Kaila is always commendable. He has collected and transcribed most of the Mundhum with the help of Limbu Phedangma, Samba, Yeba, and Yema. I personally feel indebted to his huge contribution to the Limbu community by preserving Limbu Mundhum.
Years ago, in the night of the Tongsing Takma ritual, my father used to recite Mundhum and its myths in a rhythmic tone from his infallible memory followed by rhythmic beating of his brass plate and harmonious shamanic dancing steps. In the morning, he would perform the ritual of Silam Sakma (blocking the path of death) for the whole family concerned by reciting the Mundhum as:
A bright place due to the moon above us
A bright place due to the sun above us
In the place of life and age 
Are life and age decreasing?
Are the bells of time and death ringing?
Now, without letting the death bell ring
I toss this incanted coin 
To block the path of the death.
(Excerpts translated from the Tongsing Takma Mundhum: Aakhyan Ra Anusthan by Bairagi Kaila)
With these words, he would toss the coin in the name of each family member until the intended side of the coin overturned in the ground. The turning of the expected side of the coin is believed to have blocked the path of death, as a part of the ritual. I do not claim the efficacy of this ritual in the real time, but the psychological and mental asset of such rituals were certainly an important part of the community in past.
Once ardent practitioner of Mundhum based rituals, my father would spend hours discussing about Mundhum and its various myths deciphering their meaning and implications to us. He adored Mundhum as a treasure for Limbu community that teaches us to live in harmony with nature. He used to say all natural entities be it rivers, hills, caves, forests, or anything that we get from nature, have to be worshiped and preserved because they support human life in one way or the other. He was not being philosophical at that time, neither had he had any idea of the subject but he was simply passing his impression of Mundhum for our generation. Today, I feel that humankind have already deferred the deadline to respect the nature, by exploiting its resources to the fullest extent and wreaking an unprecedented havoc in its beauty. And obviously, we are getting paid by the effects of global warming and other disastrous natural phenomena for our irresponsible action towards nature threatening the existence of life in the blue planet.
Even though we listened to his stories enthusiastically, my father could figure out that his listeners were losing interests in them. Then his remarks would be same as always - time has changed…in our time………and so on. At this moment, I can sense the meaning of his words but the time has changed for me too. But what I fear most is I even may not have the same words to convey to my children by referring to the nostalgia of our time. The indispensable cultural values that ​​we have inherited from our ancestors have been eroding with the passage of time. We are living in an age of cultural deviation and oblivion. Now, when I sit by my ailing father living in his early eighties, I sometimes envisage him as Truganini (1812 –1876) the last full blood Aboriginal Tasmanian, whose culture and identity were completely swept away by the wave of 19th century colonialism.

The Summer of 2005 was my first birthday and no guests visited. There was a cake and a toy.
The toy was a helicopter with a broken wing that didn’t turn-on or chuff. I always wondered why it was like that.
Also, to bear in mind, my parents emigrated from Nepal when I was seven months old. I was too small, too chubby, and too witless to contribute to their struggle except for the grins and the giggles that made it easier for them to move on with their days.
Not until sophomore year in high school did I learn how much my parents had struggled during the early years in the US. I also found the helicopter didn’t run, only because my parents couldn’t afford a toy during that time. So, they rummaged that broken chopper from someone else’s trash.
Nonetheless, my intent in this narrative is not to inspire any sympathy. For me, this story is not as somber as it sounds. In fact, I got an opportunity to understand my parents’ struggle with a newfound humility. Their story and their sacrifice helped me get through a struggle, even if minor, was all my own.
Somewhere around the same time I was in high school, and nothing was going well. More importantly, I could not seem to get faster running cross-country. I had always loved running since early on, but at that point, the sport felt more like an obligation than a passion. I strove for motivation but failed to find one. At the heart of this disquietude, I knew the slip-up was only because without a clear plan, I just was not driven.
As fate would have it, one morning in September of 2019, while I was struggling to run at the practice, Jaclyn, one of my faster running mates, asked me to run with her. I refused at first because I knew I couldn't keep up with her and yet, for some reason, I decided to plug away. That day, I called out on whatever was holding me back and I ran with her. I ran for myself and for my parents, and I ran to be the best version of my possibility.
This gave me confidence and made me realize that I could accomplish what I thought was unimaginable. I realized my doubts and insecurities stemmed from my failure to push myself outside my comfort zone and that merely wanting something is not enough. I also had to act on it!
After that day, I proactively began creating a routine that I consistently followed. Just in a few weeks, I started seeing improvements.
Aside from the track, I also got in touch with a few friends from Nepal and created a think tank named ‘The Connectors.’ The goal of this group was to support Nepal’s diplomacy with the other countries, especially its neighbors like India, China, and Bangladesh.
I became one of the senior captains in the Colleyville Heritage High School Cross-Country team. We qualified for the state three years consecutively and our team finished fourth among 5A Schools in Texas during the 2021 season. Meanwhile, I also frequently volunteer by visiting the middle school runners to motivate and encourage them.
I often think about that moment in my sophomore year where something snapped into the place, and I began to turn my life around. Some part of me believes that moment is defined by my friend’s lending hand while the other part is the inspiration from my parents' adversities.
Nietzsche once said, 'A person with a Why can bear any How or What.'
That forlorn summer morning, that dwindling moment of despair and gratitude, when those hapless hands picked that toy, that’s where I found my ‘Why’.
The lowest moment my dad and my mom endured to give me a wisp of joy is now my highest moment to give them theirs back.

For a very long time we have been hearing the government’s intention to regulate the over the top (OTT) and other services providing internet content in Nepal. Well, the wait is over as the government has recently come up with the amendment in the National Broadcasting Regulation 1995 (2052).
The 11th amendment of the regulation has included OTT, video on demand (VOD), and internet television under 'Other Means of Communications'. With the said inclusion, the regulation now requires OTT and internet television to register to provide its service in Nepal. The term OTT has been defined as the service of displaying the programs as per the demand of the consumer through the internet without using the means of direct to home (DTH) cable or satellite and such term shall also include the media streaming services through other platforms by the means of internet. Further, internet television (Internet TV) has included the regular act of transmission of the self-produced audio-visual programs through the internet.
This definition will require popular streaming service providers like YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. to obtain approval from the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology. The regulation has further provisioned for the mandatory requirement of the cache server within Nepal if the OTT service provider intends to make any member or customer in Nepal or acquire any kind of fees from Nepal. It has also required the storage of user information within the server of Nepal. Further, the OTT service providers should keep a record of the programs transmitted by them, for at least 60 days and the same shall also be made accessible to the ministry and other governmental authorities in the process of investigations.
The content to be displayed through OTT must also be subject to categorization as per age. The “U” rating must be granted for such content which is appropriate to all the age groups whereas “A” rating is provided to the content for the age group above 18 years. “R” rating, similarly, provided to the content appropriate to the age group of 10-18 years.
The regulation also provisions that the ministry can take control of such equipment or make necessary arrangements to disallow the operation of such equipment which has been used for transmission or communication of the program in an unauthorized manner without obtaining necessary license or approval as required by the regulation.
As the regulation has mandatorily required approval of the ministry in order to distribute the content through the internet in Nepal, it is worth observing to see whether the foreign companies providing such services to the users based in Nepal comply. Due to the limited market of users in Nepal, it is less likely the service providers would be willing to register in Nepal as it may also trigger other compliance requirement as per the laws of Nepal. Further, it would be important to see what the government’s next step would be as the regulation is silent on the time period to comply with such requirements and what would it do to foreign OTT service providers if they fail to comply with the licensing requirement of the regulation.

I was first introduced to Panauti by John Sanday, the British conservation architect, who was in charge in the 1970s of the restoration of Hanuman Dhoka palace at the center of Kathmandu by UNESCO and has resided in the Nepali capital from that time on.
It was in 1976. I was already familiar with Nepal and the Kathmandu Valley. I had been the cultural attaché at the French Embassy in 1970-71, and afterward spent nearly one year in the remote Newar village of Pyangaun in Lalitpur district, a village inhabited by Jyapu paddy-cultivators. These farmers were also at that time makers of bamboo boxes for measuring grains (rice, wheat), pyang in Nepal Bhasha. They used to exchange these boxes against food grains at several localities of the Kathmandu Valley in winter. Subsequently, I prepared and passed a PhD dissertation in the field of social anthropology (Paris University) on that village and joined the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), the main public organization for research in France, in 1975. I had learned local languages with students and teachers and was quite fluent at that time in Newari.
I remember very well my first time in Panauti with John Sanday. We were looking for a house to rent. The authorities of the locality guided us toward a Karmacharya family inhabiting in the lower part of the town, toward the sacred confluence of the Rosi and Punyamati rivers. The gharpatini, mistress of the house, and her daughter welcomed us. They offered us some food with very strong ayela (rice alcohol) and rented me a house nearby, with a very nice view of Indreshwar Mahadev temple and the Jangam math, the religious establishment where the priests of the Shaivite three-storied temple were inhabiting. The ground floor was used by a health post and a small vegetable garden was attached. It was an ideal place to work. It was decided that three young French architects would join me to undertake a full basic research work on Panauti. During our common period of fieldwork, we would focus on space and architecture. One of these architects, Vincent Barré, was already my friend. He came some years before to Pyangaun to help me draw a map of the village.
I moved to Panauti in the rainy season. I came on foot from Godavari with my cook and porter Sarkiman, crossing the range and descending on the other side of the mountain. We didn’t know the way exactly and got lost in the clouds. It was raining. We had to spend a night on the way in a Tamang house. We arrived at our destination the next morning. My three friends, who came by bus from Kathmandu the day before, were already there. We started the work immediately. Some inhabitants from Panauti joined us to draw a detailed map of the locality, which at that time didn’t exist. We set up three teams with local people for this topographical survey. It took us about 10 days to complete the preliminary job with double decameter ropes. All corners of the city were mapped. It must be said that from the very beginning Panauti inhabitants proved to be very friendly and cooperative with us. This assistance continued in all phases of the research. Perhaps they guessed that their locality would derive some benefits out of this research.
This happened to be true: some years later, in the 1990s, the cultural branch of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs started renovating the main temples of the city, that were in a sorry condition, under the supervision of the Nepali Department of Archaeology. Several other projects focused on more secular matters, especially schools, platforms alongside the streets and an underground pipe system were also launched and implemented. In addition, some grants were allocated to the local youths in the field of technology. Robert Le Foll, a former member of the French Parliament, has been very active in this regard. Panauti became a symbol of French and Nepali cooperation.
Three persons from Panauti collaborated with us in a very important and fruitful manner: Ananta Madhikarmi, Chandeshwari Buddhacharya (Shakya), Shiva Jangam, who at the time was the priest of Indreshwar Mahadev temple, and Bisunath Tamrakar. I remember that I surveyed with Ananta Madhikarmi all the houses of the small city, collecting data on the population, as well as on economic data of every family, for instance the surface area (in ropani) of their paddy-fields whether privately owned or just labored as tenants. The French architects stayed for about three months in Panauti and went back to Paris where they were running a private architect enterprise. For my own part, I concentrated the following years almost entirely on Panauti city, its social and religious organization. My rented house was very convenient. I could invite some guests and friends from Kathmandu for lunch or for the weekend. It was also an appropriate place to work with my different local informants and offer them some tea. During the daytime, I used to spend time in the various tea stalls discussing with people on different subjects. And every night, I took a tour of the city along the river and within the market area. I made fantastic day trips with Ananta in the surrounding villages and religious places.
Altogether, I spent nearly one year on the spot, from 1977 till 1980. At the end, I offered a bhoj (a feast) to all the persons, Newars and Jangams mostly, who worked with me in the community. I had to sacrifice a goat to the nearby Ganesh on that occasion. Afterward, I presented my ethnographical materials in the Paris University in 1982 and obtained a second more elaborate PhD, after the first one obtained thanks to my study of Pyangaun. We call this superior type of Doctorate “Doctorat d’Etat” in French (this type of Doctorate disappeared from the university courses a little later). With the French architects, our common book written in French language was finally published in 1981 in Paris: Panauti, uneville au Népal (Panauti, a Town in Nepal). It is focused on history, social organization, use of space, domestic and religious architecture. A facsimile edition has been published recently in Kathmandu by Vajra Publications. Unfortunately, this book has not yet been translated in English or Nepali.
In 1976, Panauti, a multi-caste locality, counted around 2,900 inhabitants, among which the vast majority were Newars (97%). It was a small historic city with an important market hub and a great number of pasals (shops) where the surrounding villagers could buy nearly all the items they needed. The market extension at the entrance of the locality, near the Maneshwari (Varahi) temple, already existed in its primary form. It developed dramatically in the following years, destabilizing the life of the small city and redirecting the market activities from the center to the periphery.
In my views, the small town of Panauti can be analyzed through two main different paradigms: the mandalic (or cosmological) model and the socioeconomic change paradigm. I had already recently published a book with a number of photographs on the second aspect: Panauti: Past and present (1976-2020). Let me focus here on the mandalic structure.
At first, the triangular shape of the city is clear. Panauti lies at the confluence of two rivers: the Punyamati to the north, and the Rosikhola to the south. The top of the triangle is pointed to the east. It is believed that a third river—subterranean, invisible river—supposedly flowing from the north under the Brahmayani three-storied temple, meets there. This third hidden river conveys a high sacral aura to the spot. The ritual place, called triveni (confluence of three rivers), is located at this junction and contains many religious monuments. This important religious confluence is visited by religious people every morning and evening. The inhabitants of the surrounding villages come there for cremation.
This triveni confluence gives to Panauti the status of a famous pilgrimage site, known all over central Nepal and even in Northern India. Every 12 years, the Makar Mela (fair) is celebrated on that very place, in the solar month of Magh (January-February). On that occasion, thousands of pilgrims wash away their sins by bathing at the confluence of the three rivers. I described this festival in a long article published 10 years ago in a volume called Sin and Sinners (Brill, 2012). According to the inhabitants, the city has a form of a fish. The main temple of Indreshwar Mahadev, originally built in the 13th century by a Newar princess named Birma Devi and run by Jangam (Lingayat) priests, is related to this religious confluence. The outer impressive struts, which decorate the religious monument with eminent figures of Hindu mythology, are a testimony of the antiquity of the temple. In 1977, we asked the children of Panauti to draw a map of their city, as they imagined. All represented their locality in a triangular form, the triveni oriented upward, to the north, giving to the city the form of a mountain (except one who placed the apex of the triangle downward).
Yet, this structure is not enough to understand the city. In the 1970s, the urban zone of Panauti was still clearly separated from the outside by an outer circle of eight goddesses’ temples, dedicated to the Ashta (eight) Matrika of the Hindu-Buddhist Tantric tradition. A specific direction in space corresponds to each of these goddesses. They protect the city against diseases and evil spirits and are regularly worshipped on specific days of the lunar calendar. The temple of Brahmayani, is the most important of these religious monuments. It faces the confluence of the rivers, on the opposite bank of the city.
This outer religious ring is centered on a large esplanade located at the epicenter of the old city, which is called layku, royal palace, by the local people. Located nearby, a small altar is dedicated to the ancient divinity and guardian deity of the Newar Malla kings, the Taleju goddess. Offerings are made there every year, during Dashain festival (mostly in October). This zone is presently under archaeological investigation by the Nepali Department of Archaeology. As a matter of fact, during a temporary period of the medieval age, Panauti had been the seat of a small independent or semi-independent kingdom/principality. In addition, as all Newar settlements, Panauti is divided between an upper part (thane) and a lower part, (kwane) according to the direction for the nearby river. This division passes through the “royal” center of the city.
This geometrical spatial structure, a center surrounded by eight temples supposedly located in the eight directions of the universe, gives to Panauti the form of a mandala religious diagram, a micro-representation of the universe. The Karmacharyas who are presently the Tantric priests of these goddesses’ sanctuaries, still have a clear vision of this cosmic configuration. It was applied to Panauti during the Malla medieval time to convey to the locality a royal status and to give her a prestigious microcosmic image of the universe. In this regard, Panauti can be considered as a reduced form of the neighboring larger Hindu city of Bhaktapur, where the German researchers (Kölver and Gutschow) have uncovered a similar layout, associated with identical religious representations. As I showed in my research works, the mandalic structure of the city still dominates the religious life of Panauti and comes in full light during the main religious festival celebrated there, particularly during Dashain celebrations and the main jatra (festival, procession) of the city, in the month of May, just before the rainy season: the Jyaa Punhi festival.

The Nepal Academy has recently published photojournalist Bharat Bandhu Thapa's picture book 'Nepal in Pictures'.
The 320-page book includes over 500 photographs depicting tourism, arts, culture and society from Mechi in the east to Mahakli in the west and the height of Mt Everest to the lowlands of Kechanakaval. 
""My objective was to ensure that those who want to know Nepal get to see the main views and know the main specialties of the country in a single book. I was, therefore, working on it for a long time,"" Thapa tells Setopati. ""Nepal is such a big country that it is not possible to include the whole country in 320 pages. But I have tried to include different possibilities of the country as far as I know in this book.""
He added that the book will be polished further in the future. 
The pictures in the books depict places from Olangchung Gola in the east to Kalapani in the Far West, Khaptad, Badimalika, Upper Dolpo, Lumbini, Janaki Temple, Shukaphant to the culture of the Kathmandu Valley. ""Most of the pictures in the book have been clicked by me. But I have not travelled across the whole country. I was undecided about whether to include the places I have not visited or not,"" he reveals. ""I finally decided that those places should not be excluded from the book even if I have not visited.""
He has sought photos of those places from his friends and says that has prevented the book from being incomplete.

123,blog,https://en.setopati.com/blog/157720,"
I want to preface this blog by clarifying that what I am positing here is not an attack on anybody’s personal integrity but an attempt to reveal a tendency, perhaps all too human, that often underpins our political biases and colors our vision in such a way that we lose sight of the future.
The political bias I am going to describe here is something that I prefer to call as “the bias of the present,” or, in other words, the tendency to view current political climate as though it is going to continue as it is forever in the future. Adam Gopnik, a popular writer for the US-based magazine, “The New Yorker,” calls it “presentism,” which he defines as, “an assumption that what is happening now is going to keep on happening, without anything happening to stop it.” I prefer to use the word “bias” because of the unreasonable prejudice attached to this kind of thinking.
This kind of bias in thinking is now famously attributed to Francis Fukuyama, the renowned political thinker, who, at one time, declared that the world had come to an “end of history” with liberal capitalist democracies being the climactic endpoint. Fukuyama, who is still pilloried for his rather Panglossian view, argued that countries all over the world were becoming more freer, more liberal, more tolerant, and getting closer and closer to a utopia very similar to the liberal democracies in the West. Fukuyama’s grand utterances are seen today as a cautionary—and an instructive—moment for public intellectuals who are inclined to make sweeping claims about the future by simply looking at the current trends.
Sadly, the current Bibeksheel Sajha Party (BSP), which was supposed to represent the optimism of the youths in the country, seems to be doing a Fukuyama in reverse. Rabindra Mishra and his like-minded coterie in the current BSP formed after the recent purges, are engaged in an overly pessimistic portrayal of present Nepal and have accordingly projected a pessimistic future for the country as though the situation can only get worse from here. Under Mishra, the current BSP apparatus seems almost eager to see the current situation spiral out of control so that their egos will be satisfied, and their recently espoused political lines, vindicated. But in so doing, Mishra and the BSP have not only led the movement of the youths astray but have also muddled the public perception by overestimating their own power while underestimating the fundamental feature of a democracy, namely its auto-correctional tendencies.
In the past BSP was popular among the youths because the party embodied the hopes and optimism that can only spring from the resourceful idealism and energy of the young people. No one expected BSP to form a viable alternative to the prevailing political parties, but everyone took pleasure from the fact that the youths were raising the consciousness of the public by demanding accountability from public officials and showing a new possibility for the future. Alongside the civil society, BSP stood at a sweet spot (call it the Goldilocks of Nepali politics), just outside the fray of everyday politics, but also within it in such a way that it could act both as a party, demanding accountability and good governance, but also as an idealisticentity that projected an optimistic and much-needed normative framework for the future of the country’s politics. The party was extremely successful given its limited reach and resources. The demonstrations against Nepal Banda, in particular, became a huge success while the party also gained enormous support in its fight against government corruption and incompetency, especially in the demonstrations against increasing instances of rapes and sexual assaults around the country.
The party was doing exactly what it was supposed to do until Mishra woke up one morning and blindsided his own party members—who had sacrificed their youthful energy, time, and resources—by highjacking the party and free riding on its goodwill. An idealistic party that represented hope for the future was overnight turned into an in-group that delighted in the same muck that it was supposed to transcend.
Now, there is no doubt that Rabindra Mishra is a gentleman who is genuinely worried about the current state of affairs in the country. In fact, as someone who is extremely self-aware of his public persona, Mishra, in my opinion, is willing to maintain a level of honesty and transparency that has not yet been seen from any of our leaders. There is no doubt in his honest endeavors. However, a nice coiffeur and a bright persona can only take you so far when the political line you have chosen depends on painting a dark picture. Mishra has, either wittingly or unwittingly, narrowed the imagination of the youths in the country by taking their movement to a dead end. He has done a great disservice by putting his ego before the ethos of the youths.
Most importantly though, Mishra and the current BSP are omitting a fundamental difference between the current political system—however flawed—that we have versus the system that they are advocating for: the system that we currently have has an inbuilt feature that will slowly but effectively autocorrect its mistakes, while the system that the current BSP is advocating for has an inbuilt bug that will only rear its ugly head again and again.
Like many others, I looked at BSP as a party of youths who were not beholden to any established political power. Despite its limited clout, the party was able to transcend the filth of Nepali politics and demand accountability by galvanizing the youths who brought new energy, vision, and optimism to an otherwise ossified party culture in Nepal. Just as the Nepali people were only beginning to believe and share the idealism of the youths, the bias of the present took over BSP and brought the project to a screeching halt.

The rebellious Russian mercenary commander who ordered his troops to march on Moscow before abruptly reversing course will move to neighboring Belarus and not face prosecution, the Kremlin said Saturday, as part of a deal to defuse a crisis that represented the most significant challenge to President Vladimir Putin in his more than two decades in power.
The charges against Yevgeny Prigozhin for mounting an armed rebellion will be dropped and the troops who joined him also will not be prosecuted, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced, and fighters from his Wagner Group who did not take part in the uprising will be offered contracts by the Defense Ministry.
Putin had vowed to punish those behind the armed uprising led by his onetime protege, whose forces seized a key military facility in southern Russia before advancing on the capital. In a televised speech to the nation, Putin called the rebellion a “betrayal” and “treason.”
In allowing Prigozhin and his forces to go free, Peskov said Putin’s “highest goal” was “to avoid bloodshed and internal confrontation with unpredictable results.”
Moscow had braced for the arrival of the Wagner forces by erecting checkpoints with armored vehicles and troops on the city’s southern edge. Red Square was shut down, and the mayor urged motorists to stay off some roads.
But after the deal was struck, Prigozhin announced that while his men were just 200 kilometers (120 miles) from Moscow, he had decided to retreat to avoid “shedding Russian blood.” His troops were ordered back to their field camps in Ukraine, where they have been fighting alongside Russian regular soldiers.
Prigozhin has demanded the ouster of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, long the target of his withering criticism for his conduct of the war in Ukraine. On Friday, he accused forces under Shoigu’s command of attacking Wagner camps and killing “a huge number of our comrades.”
Prigozhin did not say whether the Kremlin had responded to his demand. Peskov said the issue could not have been discussed during the negotiations, which were conducted by the president of Belarus, and is the “exclusive prerogative of the commander in chief.”
If Putin were to agree to Shoigu’s ouster, it could be politically damaging for the president after he branded Prigozhin a backstabbing traitor.
Early Saturday, Prigozhin’s private army appeared to control the military headquarters in Rostov-on-Don, a city 660 miles (over 1,000 kilometers) south of Moscow, which runs Russian operations in Ukraine, Britain’s Ministry of Defense said.
A nighttime video from the city posted on Russian messaging app channels showed people cheering Wagner troops as they left Rostov-on-Don. Prigozhin was seen riding in one of the vehicles, and people greeted him and some ran to shake his hand as he lowered the window. The regional governor later said that all of the troops had left the city.
Wagner troops and equipment also were in Lipetsk province, about 360 kilometers (225 miles) south of Moscow.
Authorities declared a “counterterrorist regime” in Moscow and its surrounding region, enhancing security and restricting some movement. On the southern outskirts, troops erected checkpoints, arranged sandbags and set up machine guns. Crews dug up sections of highways to slow the march.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin declared Monday a non-working day for most residents as part of the heightened security, a measure that remained in effect even after the retreat.
The dramatic developments came exactly 16 months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Europe’s largest conflict since World War II, which has killed tens of thousands, displaced millions and reduced cities to rubble.
Ukrainians hoped the Russian infighting would create opportunities for their army to take back territory seized by Russian forces.
Ben Barry, senior fellow for land warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that even with a deal, Putin’s position has probably been weakened and “these events will have been of great comfort to the Ukrainian government and the military.”
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said late Saturday, shortly before Prigozhin announced his retreat, that the march exposed weakness in the Kremlin and “showed all Russian bandits, mercenaries, oligarchs” that it is easy to capture Russian cities “and, probably, arsenals.”
Switching into Russian in his daily video address, Zelenskyy said “the man from the Kremlin” was “very afraid.” He repeated his calls for the West to supply Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets and ATACMS tactical ballistic missiles.
Prigozhin had vowed earlier that his fighters, whom he said number some 25,000, would not surrender because “we do not want the country to live on in corruption, deceit and bureaucracy.”
“Regarding the betrayal of the motherland, the president was deeply mistaken. We are patriots of our homeland,” he said in an audio message on his Telegram channel.
He posted video of himself at the military headquarters in Rostov-on-Don and claimed his forces had taken control of the airfield and other military facilities in the city without any deaths or even “a single gunshot.”
Russian media, however, reported that several helicopters and a military communications plane were downed by Wagner troops. The Kremlin referred a question about the losses to the Defense Ministry, which has not commented.
The short-lived rebellion came as Russia is “fighting the toughest battle for its future,” Putin said, with the West piling sanctions on Moscow and arming Ukraine.
“The entire military, economic and information machine of the West is waged against us,” Putin said.
State-controlled TV networks led their newscasts with Putin’s statement and reported the tense situation in Rostov-on-Don. Broadcasters also carried statements from top Russian officials and lawmakers voicing support for Putin, condemning Prigozhin and urging him to back down.
Chechnyan strongman Ramzan Kadyrov, who in the past has sided with Prigozhin in his criticisms of Russia’s military, also expressed support for Putin’s “every word.”
“The mutiny needs to be suppressed,” Kadyrov said.
Wagner troops have played a crucial role in the Ukraine war, capturing the eastern city of Bakhmut, an area where the bloodiest and longest battles have taken place. But Prigozhin has increasingly criticized the military brass, accusing it of incompetence and of starving his troops of munitions.
In announcing the rebellion, Prigozhin accused Russian forces of attacking the Wagner camps in Ukraine with rockets, helicopter gunships and artillery. He alleged that Gen. Valery Gerasimov, chief of the General Staff, ordered the attacks following a meeting with Shoigu in which they decided to destroy the military contractor.
The Defense Ministry denied attacking the camps.
The 62-year-old Prigozhin, a former convict, has longstanding ties to Putin and won lucrative Kremlin catering contracts that earned him the nickname “Putin’s chef.”
He gained attention in the U.S. when he and a dozen other Russian nationals were charged with operating a covert social media campaign aimed at fomenting discord ahead of Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential election victory. Wagner has sent military contractors to Libya, Syria, several African countries and eventually Ukraine.
The rebellion appeared likely to further hinder Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine, as Kyiv’s forces probed Russian defenses in the initial stages of a counteroffensive.
Orysia Lutsevych, the head of the Ukraine Forum at the Chatham House think tank in London, said the infighting could create confusion and potential division among Russian military forces.
“Russian troops in Ukraine may well now be operating in a vacuum, without clear military instructions, and doubts about whom to obey and follow,″ Lutsevych said. “This creates a unique and unprecedented military opportunity for the Ukrainian army.”
Western countries monitored developments closely. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with his counterparts in the other G7 countries and the European Union’s foreign affairs representative, his spokesman said, adding that Blinken “reiterated that support by the United States for Ukraine will not change.”
Latvia and Estonia, two NATO countries that border Russia, said they were increasing security at their borders.

Meta is poised to unveil a new app that appears to mimic Twitter — a direct challenge to the social media platform owned by Elon Musk.
A listing for the app, called Threads, appeared on Apple’s App Store, indicating it would debut as early as Thursday. It is billed as a “text-based conversation app” that is linked to Instagram, with the listing teasing a Twitter-like microblogging experience.
“Threads is where communities come together to discuss everything from the topics you care about today to what’ll be trending tomorrow,” it said.
Instagram users will be able to keep their user names and follow the same accounts on the new app, according to screenshots displayed on the App Store listing. Meta declined to comment on the app.
Musk replied “yeah” to a tweet from Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey saying, “All your Threads are belong to us,” along with a screenshot from the App Store’s privacy section showing what personal information might be collected by the new Meta app.
Threads could be the latest headache for Musk, who acquired Twitter last year for $44 billion and has been making changes that have unnerved advertisers and turned off users, including new daily limits on the number of tweets people can view.
Meta has good timing because Twitter users are growing frustrated with Musk’s changes and looking for a viable alternative, said Matt Navarra, a social media consultant.
Threads presents the “opportunity to jump to a platform that can give them many of the things that they want Twitter to continue to be that it no longer is,” he said.
Allowing Instagram users to port their profile to Threads could give the new app more traction with potential users by providing a ready-made set of accounts for them to follow, said Navarra, former director of social media at tech news site The Next Web and digital communications adviser for the British government.
Twitter has rolled out a series of unpopular changes in recent days, including a requirement for users to be verified to use the online dashboard TweetDeck. The policy announced Monday takes effect in 30 days and appears to be aimed at raising extra revenue because users need to pay have their accounts verified under Musk’s changes.
TweetDeck is popular with companies and news organizations, allowing users to manage multiple Twitter accounts.
It comes after outcry over Musk’s announcement this weekend that Twitter has limited the number of tweets users can view each day — restrictions that the billionaire Tesla CEO described as an attempt to stop unauthorized scraping of potentially valuable data.
Still, some users might be put off by Meta’s data privacy track record, Navarra said. And would-be Twitter challengers like Mastodon have found it a challenge to sign up users.
“It’s hard to tell whether the upset and discontent is strong enough to make a mass exodus or whether it will be somewhat of a slow erosion,” Navarra said.
Musk’s rivalry with Meta Platforms also could end up spilling over into real life. In an online exchange between Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the two tech billionaires seemingly agreed to a cage match face-off, though it’s unclear if they will actually make it to the ring.

The Taliban are banning women’s beauty salons in Afghanistan, a government spokesman said Tuesday.
It’s the latest curb on the rights and freedoms of Afghan women and girls, following edicts barring them from education, public spaces and most forms of employment.
A spokesman for the Taliban-run Virtue and Vice Ministry, Mohammad Sidik Akif Mahajar, didn’t give details of the ban. He only confirmed the contents of a letter circulating on social media.
The ministry-issued letter, dated June 24, says it conveys a verbal order from the supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada. The ban targets the capital, Kabul, and all provinces, and gives salons throughout the country a month’s notice to wind down their businesses. After that period, they must close and submit a report about their closure. The letter doesn’t give reasons for the ban.
Its release comes days after Akhundzada claimed that his government has taken the necessary steps for the betterment of women’s lives in Afghanistan.
It drew criticism from human and women’s rights defenders on social media.
The United Nations on Tuesday also said it was engaged with the authorities in Afghanistan to get the ban on beauty salons reversed. The U.N. mission in Afghanistan, or UNAMA, took to Twitter, urging the Taliban to halt the edict.
“This new restriction on women’s rights will impact negatively on the economy&contradicts stated support for women entrepreneurship,” it said.
Earlier, one beauty salon owner said she was her family’s only breadwinner after her husband died in a 2017 car bombing. She didn’t want to be named or mention her salon for fear of reprisals.
Between eight to 12 women visit her Kabul salon every day, she said.
“Day by day they (the Taliban) are imposing limitations on women,” she told The Associated Press. “Why are they only targeting women? Aren’t we human? Don’t we have the right to work or live?”
Despite initial promises of a more moderate rule than during their previous stint in power in the 1990s, the Taliban have imposed harsh measures since seizing Afghanistan in August 2021 as U.S. and NATO forces were pulling out.
They have barred women from public spaces, like parks and gyms, and cracked down on media freedoms. The measures have triggered a fierce international uproar, increasing the country’s isolation at a time when its economy has collapsed — and have worsened a humanitarian crisis.

President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that the Russian people are “united as never before,” seeking to project confidence in the wake of a short-lived revolt while participating in a meeting of an international organization that offered him a sympathetic audience.
The Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting, hosted via videoconference by India, was Putin’s first multilateral summit since an armed rebellion rattled Russia and comes as he is eager to show the West has failed to isolate Moscow over its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
The Asian security grouping, founded by Russia and China to counter Western alliances, also welcomed Iran as a new member, bringing its membership to nine nations.
Speaking by video link from the Kremlin, Putin praised the organization for “playing an increasingly significant role in international affairs, making a real contribution to maintaining peace and stability, ensuring sustainable economic growth of the participating states, and strengthening ties between peoples.”
He thanked the member states for supporting Russian authorities during the short-lived mutiny mounted by Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, and said the West had turned Ukraine into “a virtually hostile state — anti-Russia.” Putin has frequently lashed out at the West for its support of Ukraine in the war.
The summit presented an opportunity for Putin to show he remains in control after the insurrection left some wondering about divisions among Russian elites.
“The Russian people are united as never before,” he said. “The solidarity and responsibility for the fate of the fatherland was clearly demonstrated by the Russian political circles and the entire society by standing as a united front against the attempted armed rebellion.”
Earlier speakers avoided direct references to the war, while bemoaning its global consequences.
A declaration adopted at the virtual summit also made no reference to Ukraine, but it said threats and challenges are ``becoming more and more complex, destructive and dangerous, existing conflicts are aggravating and new conflicts are emerging.”
In his opening speech, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned of global challenges to food, fuel and fertilizer supplies but didn’t mention the war in Ukraine. Trade in all three has been disrupted by the war.
He also took a veiled swipe at Pakistan, saying the group shouldn’t hesitate to criticize countries that are “using terrorism as an instrument of its state policy.”
“Terrorism poses a threat to regional peace and we need to take up a joint fight,” Modi said without naming Pakistan. India regularly accuses Pakistan of training and arming insurgent groups, a charge that Islamabad denies.
In his speech, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif denounced terrorism and defended his country’s role in the fight against it.
“While the sacrifices made by Pakistan in fighting terrorism are without parallel, this scourge continues to plague our region and remains a serious obstacle to the maintenance of peace and stability,” Sharif said. “Any temptation to use it as a cudgel for diplomatic point scoring must be eschewed.”
Sharif also hailed the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, saying it could be a “game changer for connectivity, stability, peace and prosperity in the region.”
Six of the nine SCO members — Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan — reaffirmed their support for the BRI initiative, the declaration said.
India opposes the initiative because it is being built through a portion of Kashmir under the control of Pakistan that New Delhi considers to be included in its part of the divided territory.
The declaration calls for new approaches to promote more equitable and effective international cooperation. It also said the SCO is not directed against any other states and is open to broad cooperation with all.
It said the ``principles of mutual respect for sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity of states, non-interference in internal affairs and non-use of force or threats to use force, are the basis of sustainable development of international relations.”
The SCO includes the four Central Asian nations of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, all former Soviet republics in which Russian influence runs deep. India and Pakistan became members in 2017. Belarus is also in line for membership.
Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said that “the benefits of the official membership of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the SCO will be historic.”
Raisi’s speech, cited by the Iranian news agency IRNA, expressed the hope that membership will prepare the ground for improving collective security, respect for the sovereignty of member nations, sustainable development, and confronting environmental threats.
U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said in a message that the summit was taking place amid growing global challenges and risks.
“But at a time when the world needs to work together, divisions are growing, and geopolitical tensions are rising,” he said.
“These differences have been aggravated by several factors: diverging approaches to global crises; contrasting views on nontraditional security threats; and, of course, the consequences of COVID-19 and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” he said.
Chinese President Xi Jinping called on members to work toward “long-term peace and stability in the region,” according to a readout of his speech posted by state broadcaster CCTV.
He said China wants to “better synergize” the country’s Belt and Road Initiative — a trillion-dollar infrastructure investment project criticized in the West for burdening smaller countries with large amounts of debt — with other nations’ own development strategies and regional cooperation initiatives.
Even as the SCO continues to expand, the group remains at risk of competing interests or conflicts between member states.
India and Pakistan share a history of bitter relations, mainly over Kashmir, a disputed Himalayan region that is split between them but claimed by both in its entirety, and they have fought two wars over it.
Meanwhile, New Delhi and Beijing are locked in a three-year standoff of thousands of soldiers stationed along their disputed border in the eastern Ladakh region.
And the SCO summit took place as Moscow relies more deeply on Beijing as its war in Ukraine drags on. While New Delhi has avoided criticizing Russia’s invasion, Moscow’s China ties could irk India in the long run and complicate its relationship with Cold War ally Russia.

Airstrikes targeting Palestinian militants in a crowded residential area. Armored bulldozers plowing through narrow streets, crushing cars and piling up debris. Protesters burning tires. A mounting death toll.
Israel’s large-scale military raid into the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank on Monday had undeniable similarities with the second Palestinian uprising of the early 2000s — a period that claimed thousands of lives.
But the current fighting is also different from those intense years of violence. It’s more limited in scope, with Israeli military operations focused on several strongholds of Palestinian militants.
It’s also a symptom of a conflict with no foreseeable end. The Palestinian leadership is weakened, and the Israeli government has been accelerating the expansion of settlements that have eroded any chance of Palestinian statehood.
WHAT IS AN INTIFADA?
The word that means “shaking off” in Arabic was coined to describe an uprising against Israel’s military occupation that erupted in 1987. It ended in 1993 with an agreement of mutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
What became known as the first intifada was marked by widespread Palestinian protests and a fierce Israeli response. In the second uprising, which began in 2000, Palestinian militants carried out deadly suicide bombings on buses and at restaurants and hotels, eliciting crushing Israeli military reprisals.
The second uprising pitted Palestinian militant groups against a far more powerful Israeli military. Over 4,000 people died, including vast numbers of civilians. Roughly three times as many Palestinians as Israelis were killed.
Israel struck targets in a militant stronghold in the occupied West Bank with drones and deployed hundreds of troops in the area, in an incursion that resembled the wide-scale military operations carried out during the second Palestinian uprising two decades ago. Palestinian health officials said at least eight Palestinians were killed and dozens wounded.
Israeli crackdowns upended Palestinian lives, including placing tight restrictions on movement that choked the fledgling economy. For Israelis, especially during the frequent bombings of the second intifada, stepping onto a bus or going out to a restaurant was terrifying.
Those events were initially fueled by widespread participation. Many Palestinians in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem — areas captured by Israel in 1967 and claimed by the Palestinians for their state — joined in the protests.
The protests were also driven by the Palestinian leaders, including President Yasser Arafat, whom Israel accused of encouraging and abetting militants. The intifada petered out after Arafat died in 2004 and the current Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, took power.
WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW?
In the spring of 2022, a spate of Palestinian attacks against Israelis prompted Israel to launch near-nightly raids into Palestinian areas of the West Bank.
Israel said the raids were meant to stamp out militant networks. But Palestinian attacks have continued, and the death toll on both sides has risen, making last year one of the deadliest for Palestinians in the West Bank since the second intifada.
The violence has only intensified since Israel’s current far-right government, which is made up of hard-line ultranationalist settlement supporters, took power late last year.
The Palestinian death toll this year in the West Bank and east Jerusalem stands at more than 135, according to a tally by The Associated Press, nearly matching the death toll for all of 2022. Hundreds of Palestinians have been arrested. Some 24 people have been killed in Palestinian attacks against Israelis.
SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES
The region has not seen such a sustained cycle of violence since the second uprising, which lasted about five years. More recent periods of bloodshed have not lasted this long or involved such a strong show of force by the military.
The tactics seen Monday, with airstrikes, armored bulldozers and a brigade of troops, were a mainstay of the second uprising.
But analysts say that’s where the similarities end.
For one, a monthlong Israeli operation in 2002 that was seen as the peak of the fighting during the second intifada involved an intense clampdown on most cities in the West Bank. Israel’s raids over the last year have been smaller in scale. Israel’s targets are also more limited to local armed groups and militant cells.
Other differences, analysts say, include the weakened Palestinian leadership and the lack of popular participation. While protests have erupted in response to the raids, they have not engulfed the entire West Bank.
“Intifada is a people’s uprising. It’s a society that fights,” said Amir Avivi, president and founder of Israel Defense and Security Forum, a hawkish group of former military commanders. Avivi, who served as a battalion commander in the northern West Bank during the 2002 operation, claimed that the current fighting is dominated by militant groups that are funded by Israel’s archenemy, Iran.
Ziyad Abu Zayad, a Palestinian analyst and former Cabinet minister, said the fighting is best described as “waves” of Palestinian anger, not an uprising.
“The problem is not security, but rather political. And as long as there is no political solution, these waves will continue,” he said. “People, mainly young people, want to live in freedom and dignity. They see no future for themselves, and they only see oppression from the occupation.”
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
There is no end in sight to the fighting. The military raids have tended to fuel more attacks that prompt even more raids.
As attacks against Israelis have mounted, including one that killed four settlers last month, government members have called for a harsher response. They have also intensively advanced settlement building, further dimming hopes for a negotiated solution to the conflict.
The last 16 months, including Monday’s large-scale raid, showed Israel lacks a long-term vision for how to deal with the Palestinians, said Michael Milshtein, a former military official and head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University.
“We need to start thinking strategically about the Palestinian issue,” he said. “We can’t just keep plastering over it.”
Abu Zayad, the Palestinian analyst, said Israel’s government is instead pushing the Palestinians “toward more extremism and violence.”
“If there is opposition to the idea of a Palestinian state, these waves are likely to remain for long periods to come.”

The grandmother of the French teenager shot dead by police during a traffic stop pleaded Sunday for rioters to stop after five nights of unrest, while authorities expressed outrage at an attack on a mayor’s home that was hit by a burning car that injured family members.
The grandmother of 17-year-old Nahel, identified only as Nadia, said in a telephone interview with French news broadcaster BFM TV, “Don’t break windows, buses ... schools. We want to calm things down.”
She said she was angry at the officer who killed her grandson but not at the police in general and expressed faith in the justice system as France faces its worst social upheaval in years. Her grandson, identified by only his first name, was buried on Saturday.
The violence appeared to be lessening. Still, the office of Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said 45,000 police officers would again be deployed in the streets to counter anger over discrimination against people who trace their roots to former French colonies and live in low-income neighborhoods. Nahel is of Algerian descent and was shot in the Paris suburb of Nanterre.
President Emmanuel Macron held a special security meeting Sunday night and plans to meet Monday with the heads of both houses of parliament and Tuesday with the mayors of 220 towns and cities affected by the protests, said a participant in the meeting, who spoke anonymously in line with French government practices. Macron also wants to start a detailed, longer-term assessment of the reasons that led to the unrest, the official said.
Highlighting the seriousness of the rioting, Macron has delayed what would have been the first state visit to Germany by a French president in 23 years, which had been scheduled to start Sunday evening.
The interior ministry said police made 49 arrests nationwide Sunday, French media reported, down significantly from 719 arrests the day before. More than 3,000 people have been detained overall following a mass security deployment. Hundreds of police and firefighters have been injured in the violence, although authorities haven’t said how many protesters have been hurt.
French authorities were appalled on Sunday after a burning car struck the home of the mayor of the Paris suburb of L’Hay-les-Roses. Several police stations and town halls have been targeted by fires or vandalism in recent days, but such a personal attack on a mayor’s home is unusual.
Mayor Vincent Jeanbrun said his wife and one of his children were injured in the 1:30 a.m. attack while they slept and he was in the town hall monitoring the violence. Jeanbrun, of the conservative opposition Republicans party, said the attack represented a new stage of “horror and ignominy” in the unrest.
Regional prosecutor Stephane Hardouin opened an investigation into attempted murder, telling French television that a preliminary investigation suggests the car was meant to ram the house and set it ablaze. He said a flame accelerant was found in a bottle in the car.
Macron has blamed social media for fueling violence. France’s justice minister has warned that young people who share calls for violence on Snapchat or other apps could face prosecution.
The mass police deployment has been welcomed by some frightened residents of targeted neighborhoods, but it has further frustrated those who see police behavior as the core of the crisis.
On a public square in Nanterre, a young man of Senegalese descent said France would learn little from the latest unrest. Faiez Njai said of police: “They’re playing on our fears, saying that ‘If you don’t listen to us,’” — and then he pointed a finger at his temple and fired.
Video of the killing showed two officers at the window of the car, one with his gun pointed at the driver. As the teenager pulled forward, the officer fired once through the windshield. The officer accused of killing Nahel was given a preliminary charge of voluntary homicide.
Thirteen people who didn’t comply with traffic stops were fatally shot by French police last year, and three this year, prompting demands for more accountability.
“Nahel M.’s death first reflects the rules and practices for how police officers use weapons during roadside checks and, more broadly, the flawed relations between the police and young people from working-class neighborhoods,” the newspaper Le Monde said in an editorial on Saturday.
Amid the unrest, a World War II monument in Nanterre commemorating Holocaust victims and members of the French resistance was vandalized on the sidelines of a silent march Thursday to pay tribute to Nahel. The slogans included “Don’t forgive or forget” and “Police, rapists, assassins.” The European Jewish Congress denounced the vandalism as a “shameful act of disrespect for the memory of the victims of the Holocaust.”
Life in some parts of France went on as usual. In the capital, tourists thronged to the Eiffel Tower, where workers set up a nearby clock counting down to next year’s Paris Olympics. A short walk from Nanterre, a shopping mall bustled Sunday with customers from all walks of life. But in the empty square where Nahel was shot, someone had painted “The police kill” on a bench.
At the foot of a bridge near the Eiffel Tower where generations of couples have attached padlocks to symbolize lasting love, a Senegalese man selling cheap locks and keys shook his head when asked if Nahel’s killing and the ensuing violence would change anything.
“I doubt it,” he said, giving only his first name, Demba, for fear of retaliation. “The discrimination is too profound.”

 After a relative lull, Russia launched a drone attack early Sunday on Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, officials said. It was the first such attack of the war in 12 days.
All of the Iranian-made Shahed exploding drones were detected and shot down, according to Serhii Popko, the head of the Kyiv city administration. In addition to the city itself, the surrounding Kyiv region was targeted. Kyiv regional Gov. Ruslan Kravchenko reported that one person was wounded by falling debris from a destroyed drone.
Officials in the Ukrainian capital didn’t provide an exact number of drones that attacked the city. But Ukraine’s air force said that across the country, eight Shaheds and three Kalibr cruise missiles were launched by the Russians.
Further south, a 13-year-old boy was wounded in overnight shelling of Ukraine’s partially occupied southern Kherson province, said Oleksandr Tolokonnikov, spokesman for the Ukrainian administration of the province.
The child was wounded when the Russian army shelled the village of Mylove on the banks of the Dnieper River in the Beryslav district, Tolokonnikov said.
“The child was hospitalized, there is no threat to his life,” Tolokonnikov added,” he said on state TV.
Shelling of Kherson province continued Sunday morning, wounding four people in the regional capital, also called Kherson. The regional prosecutor’s office said that a residential area of the city was targeted by Russian troops operating in the Russia-occupied part of the Kherson province. “
“At least four citizens were wounded, two of them due to a targeted strike on a high-rise building,” the office wrote on Telegram.
Meanwhile, Ukraine’s military reported that the most intense fighting continued in Ukraine’s industrial east, with attacks focused around Bakhmut, Marinka and Lyman in the country’s Donetsk province, where 46 combat clashes took place.
Ukrainian forces were advancing amid a “massive offensive” on the southern and northern flanks of the destroyed city of Bakhmut, Ukraine’s Eastern Group of Forces spokesman Serhii Cherevaty told Ukrainian state television. But he didn’t mention how much progress they made. The details, he said, would be disclosed once Ukrainian forces had analyzed the situation and consolidated their positions.
In its regular update Sunday morning, the General Staff said that over the previous 24 hours, Russia had carried out 27 airstrikes, one missile strike and around 80 attacks from multiple rocket launchers, targeting regions in the north, northeast, east and south of the country.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the Black Sea port city of Odesa on Sunday — the day the country honors its navy — to hear a report from the navy commander, discuss prospects for the development of a naval drone and missile program, as well as present awards to service members.
In Russia, local officials reported that air defense systems shot down a drone over the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, while the neighboring Kursk region faced shelling attacks. No casualties or damage were reported.
Following the drama of Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin’s rebellion last week, Russian authorities remained defiant. Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of Russia’s lower house of parliament, the State Duma, said Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin came out of this situation “having strengthened his position even more both in the country and in the world.”
Russian society, he said, “having passed this test, has shown its maturity.” According to Volodin, there was “not a single example of someone supporting the rebellion.”
But Gen. Sergei Surovikin, the deputy commander of the Russian group of forces fighting in Ukraine, was believed to have been detained days after the mutiny. It’s not clear whether Surovikin, who has longtime links to Prigozhin, faces any charges or where he is being held, reflecting the opaque world of the Kremlin’s politics and uncertainty after the revolt.
Writing on Telegram, Volodin said that the Russian president “did everything to prevent bloodshed and confusion,” including explaining to Wagner fighters “the real state of affairs.” “(Putin) suggested that those who want to defend Russia continue their service with weapons in their hands. As far as I know, many of them agreed to this,” Volodin said.
In addition, the speaker of the State Duma said that he had analyzed the “challenges” Russia faced in the past, affirming that if “someone like Putin” had been leading the country in 1917 and 1991, there wouldn’t have been a revolution in Russia, and the USSR wouldn’t have collapsed.
But independent observers and analysts say that Putin may come out politically weakened after first announcing that Wagner would face harsh repercussions, only to later say that the group’s forces wouldn’t face prosecution. Prigozhin was also allowed to leave Russia for Belarus.
Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski said Sunday that Poland would send 500 police officers to join 5,000 border guards and 2,000 soldiers already on the country’s border with Belarus. It follows an announcement earlier this week that Poland would strengthen defenses on its eastern border after the relocation of Wagner fighters to Belarus.

Thousands of people logged complaints about problems accessing Twitter on Saturday after owner Elon Musk limited most users to viewing 600 tweets a day — restrictions he described as an attempt to prevent unauthorized scraping of potentially valuable data from the site.
The crackdown began to have ripple effects early Saturday, causing more than 7,500 people at one point to report problems using the social media service, based on complaints registered on Downdetector, a website that tracks online outages. Although that’s a relatively small number of Twitter’s more than 200 million worldwide users, the trouble was widespread enough to cause the #TwitterDown hashtag to trend in some parts of the world.
The service disruptions cropped up a day after Twitter began requiring people to log on to the service in order to view tweets and profiles — a change in its longtime practice to allow all comers to peruse the chatter on what Musk has frequently touted as the world’s digital town square since buying it for $44 billion last year.
In a Friday tweet, Musk described the new restrictions as a temporary measure that was taken because “we were getting data pillaged so much that it was degrading service for normal users!” Musk elaborated on the measures in a Saturday tweet that announced unverified accounts will temporarily be limited to reading 600 posts per day while verified accounts will be able to scroll through up to 6,000 posts per day.
The restrictions could result in users being locked out of Twitter for the day after scrolling through several hundred tweets.
The higher threshold allowed on verified accounts is part of an $8 per month subscription service that Musk rolled out earlier this year in an effort to boost Twitter revenue that has fallen sharply since he took over the company and laid off roughly three-fourths of the workforce to cuts costs and stave off bankruptcy.
Advertisers have since curbed their spending on Twitter, partly because of changes that have allowed more sometimes hateful and prickly content that offends a wider part of the service’s audience. Musk recently hired longtime NBC Universal executive Linda Yaccarino to become Twitter’s CEO in an effort to win back advertisers.
An Associated Press inquiry about Saturday’s access problems triggered a crude automated reply that Twitter sends to most press inquiries without addressing the question.

US President Joe Biden vowed Friday to push ahead with a new plan providing student loan relief for millions of borrowers, while blaming Republican “hypocrisy” for triggering the day’s Supreme Court decision that wiped out his original effort.
Biden said his administration had already begun the process of working under the authority of the Higher Education Act of 1965, which he called “the best path that remains to provide as many borrowers as possible with debt relief.”
In the meantime, since student loan-payment requirements are to resume in the fall, the White House is creating an “on ramp” to repayment and implementing ways to ease borrowers’ threat of default if they fall behind over the next year.
The president said the new programs will take longer than his initial effort would have to ease student loan debt.
Speaking to reporters at the White House, Biden said borrowers now angry about the court’s decision should blame Republicans. He is trying to stay on the political offensive even as the ruling undermined a key promise to young voters who will be vital to his 2024 reelection campaign.
“These Republican officials just couldn’t bear the thought of providing relief for working class, middle class Americans,” Biden said. “The hypocrisy of Republican elected officials is stunning.”
Trying to place staunch opposition to student loan forgiveness on the GOP could allow Biden’s reelection campaign to maintain the issue as one of strength in the short term. But that may ultimately offer little solace to 43 million Americans who benefited from the initial program and will now have to wait for its replacement to take shape.
“We do not want to go into excruciating debt for our entire lives to enhance our education,” Voters of Tomorrow, a Gen Z-led organization that promotes the power of young Americans, said in a statement.
The White House efforts to forgive loans were an attempt to keep a Biden promise stretching back to his 2020 campaign to wipe out student loan debt — an idea that was especially popular with young voters and progressives. Both will be key for the president in next year’s presidential race but may be less energized about supporting him after the high court’s decision.
Wisdom Cole, the national director of the NAACP Youth & College Division, said Black Americans helped put Biden in the White House, so there’s an obligation for him to “finish the job” with his pledges to provide relief for borrowers.
“It’s going to have a huge impact on the next election,” Cole said, adding, “If we don’t do this, we continue the cycle of seeing our elected leaders make promises and not follow through.”
A May poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 43% of U.S. adults approve of how Biden sought to handle student debt, similar to his approval rating overall of 40% in the same poll.
The poll suggested that Biden gets credit for his handling of the issue among young adults in particular. Fifty-three percent of adults under age 30 said they approved of Biden’s handling of student debt, compared with only 36% who approved of his job performance overall.
Senior administration officials said Biden’s top advisers had met frequently lately to prepare for a high court ruling on student loans. They also spoke with advocates and allies in Congress. After Friday’s decision, Biden met with top advisers and ordered them to immediately begin implementing a new loan plan.
The White House argues that its new efforts will stand up to future legal challenges, even given the Supreme Court’s 6-3 current conservative majority. However, the administration also insisted its original plan was legal .
Biden bristled at suggestions his efforts to ease student loan burdens got borrowers’ hopes up unnecessarily.
“I didn’t give any false hope,” he said. “The Republicans snatched away the hope that they were given.”
The political stakes are especially high since progressive Democrats in Congress and activists have been clamoring for the administration to offer an alternative to Biden’s original student loan plan for months, fearing that the Supreme Court would ultimately move to block the president’s original efforts.
Many progressives argued that the Higher Education Act was the best vehicle all along, though the administration worried that implementation might have been slower had it originally tried employing the act.
The new approach uses a provision allowing Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to “compromise, waive or release” student loans. The Biden administration used the same basis last year to forgive $6 billion in loans for borrowers who were deceived by their colleges.
The details of the new forgiveness will be negotiated through a federal rulemaking process that the administration launched Friday. The process allows the Education Department to write or change federal regulations with the weight of law.

But there’s no guarantee that the plan could survive another legal challenge.
The Higher Education Act has been used to cancel student debt but never at this scale, and lawyers for the Trump administration concluded in 2021 that the education secretary “does not have statutory authority to provide blanket or mass cancellation” under the act.
The GOP has long countered that repaying student loans is a fairness issue, and many leading Republicans celebrated Friday’s ruling. Betsy DeVos, who served as secretary of education under President Donald Trump, called Biden’s original plan “deeply unfair to the majority of Americans who don’t have student loans.”
Republicans now seeking their party’s 2024 presidential nomination lined up to applaud the decision, with former Vice President Mike Pence saying he was “pleased that the court struck down the radical left’s effort to use the money of taxpayers who played by the rules and repaid their debts in order to cancel the debt of bankers and lawyers in New York, San Francisco, and Washington.”
Addressing the Moms for Liberty conference in Philadelphia on Friday, Trump slammed Biden’s efforts on student loans as “a way of trying to buy votes, that’s all it was.” Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nation’s Nikki Haley said the Supreme Court was “right to throw out Joe Biden’s power grab.”
After Biden announced his response, some Republicans were equally quick to reject it.
“Taxpayers just got sucker punched – again – by this administration,” said Rep. Virginia Foxx, a North Carolina Republican. “Today, President Biden announced that taxpayers will be forced to pay for the costliest regulation in our nation’s history.”

The US Supreme Court on Thursday struck down affirmative action in college admissions, declaring race cannot be a factor and forcing institutions of higher education to look for new ways to achieve diverse student bodies.
The court’s conservative majority effectively overturned cases reaching back 45 years in invalidating admissions plans at Harvard and the University of North Carolina, the nation’s oldest private and public colleges, respectively.
The decision, like last year’s momentous abortion ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, marked the realization of a long-sought conservative legal goal, this time finding that race-conscious admissions plans violate the Constitution and a law that applies to colleges that receive federal funding, as almost all do.
Those schools will be forced to reshape their admissions practices, especially top schools that are more likely to consider the race of applicants.
Chief Justice John Roberts said that for too long universities have “concluded, wrongly, that the touchstone of an individual’s identity is not challenges bested, skills built, or lessons learned but the color of their skin. Our constitutional history does not tolerate that choice.”
From the White House, President Joe Biden said he “strongly, strongly” disagreed with the court’s ruling and urged colleges to seek other routes to diversity rather than let the ruling “be the last word.”
Besides the conservative-liberal split, the fight over affirmative action showed the deep gulf between the three justices of color, each of whom wrote separately and vividly about race in America and where the decision might lead.
Justice Clarence Thomas — the nation’s second Black justice, who had long called for an end to affirmative action — wrote that the decision “sees the universities’ admissions policies for what they are: rudderless, race-based preferences designed to ensure a particular racial mix in their entering classes.”
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court’s first Latina, wrote in dissent that the decision “rolls back decades of precedent and momentous progress.”

Despite government appeals for calm and vows that order would be restored, smoke billowed from cars and garbage set ablaze in the Paris suburb of Nanterre following a peaceful afternoon march in honor of the teen identified only by his first name, Nahel.
After a morning crisis meeting following violence that injured dozens of police and damaged nearly 100 public buildings, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said the number of officers in the streets would more than quadruple, from 9,000 to 40,000. In the Paris region alone, the number of officers deployed was more than doubled to 5,000.
“The professionals of disorder must go home,” Darmanin said. While there’s no need yet to declare a state of emergency — a measure taken to quell weeks of rioting in 2005 — he added: “The state’s response will be extremely firm.”
There were 100 arrests nationwide Thursday night, according to a national police spokesperson, as officials reported scattered clashes in cities across the country despite the stepped-up deployments.
In the usually tranquil Pyrenees town of Pau in southwestern France, a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a new police office, national police said. Vehicles were set on fire in Toulouse and a tramway train was torched in a suburb of Lyon, police said. Paris police said its officers made 40 arrests Thursday, some on the margins of the largely peaceful memorial march for the teen and others elsewhere.
The interior minister had reported 180 arrests nationwide before Thursday.
Bus and tram services in the Paris area shut down before sunset as a precaution to safeguard transportation workers and passengers.
The town of Clamart, home to 54,000 people in the French capital’s southwest suburbs, said it was taking the extraordinary step of imposing an overnight curfew from Thursday through Monday, citing “the risk of new public order disturbances.” The mayor of Neuilly-sur-Marne announced a similar curfew in that town in the eastern suburbs.
Marseille, the giant port city in the south of France, saw the beginnings of unrest Thursday evening, with several hundred young people roaming the city center and setting fire to trash containers, including in front of the region’s main administrative building, police said. Around 1 a.m. local time, regional officials tweeted that police were trying to disperse violent groups in the city center. Police said they had made 28 arrests, though they gave no time frame.
The unrest extended even to Brussels, where about a dozen people were detained during scuffles related to the shooting in France. Police spokeswoman Ilse Van de Keere said that several fires were brought under control and that at least one car was burned.
The shooting captured on video shocked the country and stirred up long-simmering tensions between police and young people in housing projects and other disadvantaged neighborhoods.
The teenager’s family and their lawyers haven’t said the police shooting was race-related and they didn’t release his surname or details about him.
Still, his death inflamed raw nerves in neighborhoods that have welcomed generations of immigrants from France’s former colonies and elsewhere. Their France-born children frequently complain they are subjected to police ID checks and harassment far more frequently than white people or those in more affluent neighborhoods.
Anti-racism activists renewed their complaints about police behavior.
“We have to go beyond saying that things need to calm down,” said Dominique Sopo, head of the campaign group SOS Racisme. “The issue here is how do we make it so that we have a police force that when they see Blacks and Arabs, don’t tend to shout at them, use racist terms against them and in some cases, shoot them in the head.”

Scientists have observed for the first time the faint ripples caused by the motion of black holes that are gently stretching and squeezing everything in the universe.
They reported Wednesday that they were able to “hear” what are called low-frequency gravitational waves — changes in the fabric of the universe that are created by huge objects moving around and colliding in space.
“It’s really the first time that we have evidence of just this large-scale motion of everything in the universe,” said Maura McLaughlin, co-director of NANOGrav, the research collaboration that published the results in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.
Einstein predicted that when really heavy objects move through spacetime — the fabric of our universe — they create ripples that spread through that fabric. Scientists sometimes liken these ripples to the background music of the universe.
In 2015, scientists used an experiment called LIGO to detect gravitational waves for the first time and showed Einstein was right. But so far, those methods have only been able to catch waves at high frequencies, explained NANOGrav member Chiara Mingarelli, an astrophysicist at Yale University.
Those quick “chirps” come from specific moments when relatively small black holes and dead stars crash into each other, Mingarelli said.
In the latest research, scientists were searching for waves at much lower frequencies. These slow ripples can take years or even decades to cycle up and down, and probably come from some of the biggest objects in our universe: supermassive black holes billions of times the mass of our sun.
Galaxies across the universe are constantly colliding and merging together. As this happens, scientists believe the enormous black holes at the centers of these galaxies also come together and get locked into a dance before they finally collapse into each other, explained Szabolcs Marka, an astrophysicist at Columbia University who was not involved with the research.
The black holes send off gravitational waves as they circle around in these pairings, known as binaries.
“Supermassive black hole binaries, slowly and calmly orbiting each other, are the tenors and bass of the cosmic opera,” Marka said.
No instruments on Earth could capture the ripples from these giants. So “we had to build a detector that was roughly the size of the galaxy,” said NANOGrav researcher Michael Lam of the SETI Institute.
The results released this week included 15 years of data from NANOGrav, which has been using telescopes across North America to search for the waves. Other teams of gravitational wave hunters around the world also published studies, including in Europe, India, China and Australia.
The scientists pointed telescopes at dead stars called pulsars, which send out flashes of radio waves as they spin around in space like lighthouses.
These bursts are so regular that scientists know exactly when the radio waves are supposed to arrive on our planet — “like a perfectly regular clock ticking away far out in space,” said NANOGrav member Sarah Vigeland, an astrophysicist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. But as gravitational waves warp the fabric of spacetime, they actually change the distance between Earth and these pulsars, throwing off that steady beat.
By analyzing tiny changes in the ticking rate across different pulsars — with some pulses coming slightly early and others coming late — scientists could tell that gravitational waves were passing through.
The NANOGrav team monitored 68 pulsars across the sky using the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico and the Very Large Array in New Mexico. Other teams found similar evidence from dozens of other pulsars, monitored with telescopes across the globe.
So far, this method hasn’t been able to trace where exactly these low-frequency waves are coming from, said Marc Kamionkowski, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University who was not involved with the research.
Instead, it’s revealing the constant hum that is all around us — like when you’re standing in the middle of a party, “you’ll hear all of these people talking, but you won’t hear anything in particular,” Kamionkowski said.
The background noise they found is “louder” than some scientists expected, Mingarelli said. This could mean that there are more, or bigger, black hole mergers happening out in space than we thought — or point to other sources of gravitational waves that could challenge our understanding of the universe.
Researchers hope that continuing to study this kind of gravitational waves can help us learn more about the biggest objects in our universe. It could open new doors to “cosmic archaeology” that can track the history of black holes and galaxies merging all around us, Marka said.
“We’re starting to open up this new window on the universe,” Vigeland said.

Scientists have created embryo models to help study the mysteries of early human development, the medical problems that happen before birth and why many pregnancies fail.
These models are made from stem cells, not egg and sperm, and can’t grow into babies.
“They’re complete enough to give you a picture of what may be happening in the embryo during pregnancy, but they’re not so complete that you could actually use them for reproduction,” said Insoo Hyun, an ethicist and director of life sciences at Boston’s Museum of Science. “It just will not work.”
Using models also avoids the controversy of using real embryos in research, he said.
Several groups are working on the research. Teams with researchers from the United States and England shared their work in two studies published Tuesday in the journal Nature. Other scientists in Israel and China published studies on their work earlier this month that have not yet been reviewed by peers.
While previous models mimicked pre-embryos, Hyun said the latest ones model an embryo after it has implanted in the uterus. Real human embryos can be extremely hard to see at that stage because they burrow into the uterus. Each team’s models vary in the techniques used and how complete they are, he said, with some mirroring not just the embryo but the very beginnings of the placenta and yolk sac, too.
For these types of models, scientists use a kind of stem cell that is capable of developing into many different types of cells or tissues in the body. They can be from embryos or reprogrammed from adult tissues.
The authors of one Nature paper described models that resemble human embryos nine to 14 days after fertilization.
“If we can experimentally model this period, then we can finally start asking questions about how human development happens in those very early stages that are normally hidden within the body of the mother,” said author Berna Sozen, who studies developmental stem cell biology at Yale University.
Scientists will also be able to study embryonic failure, developmental disorders and pregnancy loss, Sozen said. At this point, we don’t understand how it goes awry, she said.
In the other Nature paper, Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz, an expert in stem cell biology at the California Institute of Technology and the University of Cambridge in England, and colleagues said their model mirrors development up to 14 days from fertilization. That model contains embryonic tissues and tissues that can go on to produce structures surrounding the embryo such as the placenta and yolk sac.
Jacob Hanna of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, an author of a yet-to-be-reviewed paper, said in an email that his group’s model also mirrors human embryo development up to day 14 after fertilization. He said the structures include all embryonic membranes as well as membranes outside the embryo.
Both Hanna and Zernicka-Goetz previously helped create mouse embryo models.
Down the road, Zernicka-Goetz said human embryo models could be used to explore the effects of the environment and chemicals on early development. They could even be used to generate tissues used in new medical treatments, she said.
Sozen also envisions testing drugs on embryo models and exposing them to germs – experiments that can’t be done on people who are pregnant.
Guidelines from the International Society for Stem Cell Research say scientists cannot put any human embryo model into either a human or non-human uterus. For decades, the society had a related “14-day rule” that guided researchers on how long actual embryos can be grown in the lab — which the group recommended relaxing under limited circumstances in 2021. But because the models are not embryos, they’re not subject to the rule.
Experts said some in the public have the wrong idea about these models, believing they might be able to create pregnancies. But scientific hurdles prevent this. For example, they don’t develop a proper placenta. Even in the future, as the field progresses, there are ways to guard against bad actors who may want to try and create pregnancies from embryo models, said Hyun, who is also a member of Harvard Medical School’s Center for Bioethics.
The ethical reason for not making them complete, he said, is that “the whole point of these models is to avoid the embryo controversy.”

Yevgeny Prigozhin, owner of the private army of prison recruits and other mercenaries who have fought some of the deadliest battles in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, escaped prosecution for his abortive armed rebellion against the Kremlin and arrived Tuesday in Belarus.
The exile of the 62-year-old owner of the Wagner Group was part of a deal that ended the short-lived mutiny in Russia. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko confirmed Prigozhin was in Belarus, and said he and some of his troops were welcome to stay “for some time” at their own expense.
Prigozhin has not been seen since Saturday, when he waved to well-wishers from a vehicle in the southern city of Rostov. He issued a defiant audio statement on Monday. And on Tuesday morning, a private jet believed to belong to him flew from Rostov to an airbase southwest of the Belarusian capital of Minsk, according to data from FlightRadar24.
Meanwhile, Moscow said preparations were underway for Wagner’s troops fighting in Ukraine, who numbered 25,000 according to Prigozhin, to hand over their heavy weapons to Russia’s military. Prigozhin had said such moves were planned ahead of a July 1 deadline for his fighters to sign contracts — which he opposed — to serve under Russia’s military command.
Russian authorities also said Tuesday they have closed a criminal investigation into the uprising and are pressing no armed rebellion charge against Prigozhin or his followers.
Still, Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to set the stage for financial wrongdoing charges against an affiliated organization Prigozhin owns. Putin told a military gathering that Prigozhin’s Concord Group earned 80 billion rubles ($941 million) from a contract to provide the military with food, and that Wagner had received over 86 billion rubles (over $1 billion) in the past year for wages and additional items.
“I hope that while doing so they didn’t steal anything, or stole not so much,” Putin said, adding that authorities would look closely at Concord’s contract.
For years, Prigozhin has enjoyed lucrative catering contracts with the Russian government. Police who searched his St. Petersburg office on Saturday said they found 4 billion rubles ($48 million) in trucks outside, according to media reports the Wagner boss confirmed. He said the money was intended to pay soldiers’ families.
Prigozhin and his fighters stopped the revolt on Saturday, less than 24 hours after it began and shortly after Putin spoke on national TV, branding the rebellion leaders, whom he did not name, as traitors.
The charge of mounting an armed mutiny could have been punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Prigozhin’s escape from prosecution, at least on a armed rebellion charge, is in stark contrast to Moscow’s treatment of its critics, including those staging anti-government protests in Russia, where many opposition figures have been punished with long sentences in notoriously harsh penal colonies.
Lukashenko said some of the Wagner fighters are now in the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine that Russia illegally annexed last September.
The series of stunning events in recent days constitutes the gravest threat so far to Putin’s grip on power, occurring during the 16-month-old war in Ukraine, and he again acknowledged the threat Tuesday in saying the result could have been a civil war.
In addresses this week, Putin has sought to project stability and demonstrate authority.
In a Kremlin ceremony Tuesday, the president walked down the red-carpeted stairs of the 15th century white-stone Palace of Facets to address soldiers and law enforcement officers, thanking them for their actions to avert the rebellion.
In a further show of business-as-usual, Russian media showed Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, in his military uniform, greeting Cuba’s visiting defense minister in a pomp-heavy ceremony. Prigozhin has said his goal had been to oust Shoigu and other military brass, not stage a coup against Putin.
Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron hand for 29 years while relying on Russian subsidies and support, portrayed the uprising as the latest development in the clash between Prigozhin and Shoigu. While the mutiny unfolded, he said, he put Belarus’ armed forces on a combat footing and urged Putin not to be hasty in his response, lest the conflict spiral out of control.
He said he told Prigozhin he would be “squashed like a bug” if he tried to attack Moscow, and warned that the Kremlin would never agree to his demands.
Like Putin, the Belarusian leader portrayed the war in Ukraine as an existential threat, saying, “If Russia collapses, we all will perish under the debris.”
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov would not disclose details about the Kremlin’s deal with Prigozhin, saying only that Putin had provided “certain guarantees” aimed at avoiding a “worst-case scenario.”
Asked why the rebels were allowed to get as close as about 200 kilometers (about 125 miles) from Moscow without facing serious resistance, National Guard chief Viktor Zolotov told reporters: “We concentrated our forces in one fist closer to Moscow. If we spread them thin, they would have come like a knife through butter.”
Zolotov, a former Putin bodyguard, also said the National Guard lacks battle tanks and other heavy weapons and now would get them.
The mercenaries shot down at least six Russian helicopters and a military communications plane as they advanced on Moscow, killing at least a dozen airmen, according to Russian news reports. The Defense Ministry didn’t release information about casualties, but Putin honored them Tuesday with a moment of silence.
“Pilots, our combat comrades, died while confronting the mutiny,” he said. “They didn’t waver and fulfilled the orders and their military duty with dignity.”
Some Russian war bloggers and patriotic activists have vented outrage that Prigozhin and his troops won’t be punished for killing the airmen.
Prigozhin voiced regret for the deaths in his statement Monday, but said Wagner troops fired because the aircraft were bombing them.
In his televised address Monday night, Putin said rebellion organizers had played into the hands of Ukraine’s government and its allies. He praised the rank-and-file mutineers, however, who “didn’t engage in fratricidal bloodshed and stopped on the brink.”
A Washington-based think tank said that was “likely in an effort to retain” the Wagner fighters in Ukraine, where Moscow needs “trained and effective manpower” as it faces a Ukrainian counteroffensive.
The Institute for the Study of War also said the break between Putin and Prigozhin is likely beyond repair, and that providing the Wagner chief and his loyalists with Belarus as an apparent safe haven could be a trap.
Putin has offered Prigozhin’s fighters the choice of either coming under Russian military command, leaving service or going to Belarus.
Lukashenko said there is no reason to fear Wagner’s presence in his country, though in Russia, Wagner-recruited convicts have been suspected of violent crimes. The Wagner troops gained “priceless” military knowledge and experience to share with Belarus, he said.
But exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who challenged Lukashenko in a 2020 election that was widely seen as fraudulent and triggered mass protests, said Wagner troops will threaten the country and its neighbors.
“Belarusians don’t welcome war criminal Prigozhin,” she told The Associated Press. “If Wagner sets up military bases on our territory, it will pose a new threat to our sovereignty and our neighbors.”
While attention focused on the aftermath of the Russian rebellion, the war in Ukraine continued to take a human toll in what U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink called “terrible scenes from another brutal attack.”
Russian missiles struck Kramatorsk and a village nearby in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region with missiles, killing at least four people, including a child, and wounding some 40 others, with still others under building rubble, including in a café, authorities reported.

An audio recording that includes new details from a 2021 meeting at which former President Donald Trump discusses holding secret documents he did not declassify has been released.
The recording, from a July 2021 interview Trump gave at his Bedminster, New Jersey, resort for people working on the memoir of his former chief of staff Mark Meadows, is a critical piece of evidence in special counsel Jack Smith’s indictment of Trump over the mishandling of classified information. The recording first aired Monday on CNN’s “Anderson Cooper 360.”
The special counsel’s indictment alleges that those in attendance at the meeting with Trump — a writer, a publisher and two of Trump’s staff members — were shown classified information about a Pentagon plan of attack on an unspecified foreign country.
“These are the papers,” Trump said in a moment that seems to indicate he was holding a secret Pentagon document with plans to attack Iran. “This was done by the military, given to me.”
Trump’s reference to something he says is “highly confidential” and his apparent showing of documents to other people at the meeting could undercut his later claims in a Fox News Channel interview that he didn’t have any documents with him.
“There was no document. That was a massive amount of papers, and everything else talking about Iran and other things,” Trump said on Fox. “And it may have been held up or may not, but that was not a document. I didn’t have a document, per se. There was nothing to declassify. These were newspaper stories, magazine stories and articles.”
Trump pleaded not guilty earlier this month to 37 counts related to the alleged mishandling of classified documents kept at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.
A Trump campaign spokesman said the audio recording “provides context proving, once again, that President Trump did nothing wrong at all.”

You know instantly when someone is speaking to an infant or small child. It turns out that dolphin mothers also use a kind of high-pitched baby talk.
A study published Monday found that female bottlenose dolphins change their tone when addressing their calves. Researchers recorded the signature whistles of 19 mother dolphins in Florida, when accompanied by their young offspring and when swimming alone or with other adults.
The dolphin signature whistle is a unique and important signal — akin to calling out their own name.
“They use these whistles to keep track of each other. They’re periodically saying, ‘I’m here, I’m here’,” said study co-author Laela Sayigh, a Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution marine biologist in Massachusetts.
When directing the signal to their calves, the mother’s whistle pitch is higher and her pitch range is greater than usual, according to the study published in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
“That was true for every one of the moms in the study, all 19 of them,” said biologist Peter Tyack, a study co-author from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.
Obtaining this data was no simple feat. Over more than three decades, scientists placed special microphones multiple times on the same wild dolphin mothers in Florida’s Sarasota Bay to record their signature whistles. That included years when they had calves and when they didn’t — dolphin calves stay with their mothers for an average of three years in Sarasota, and sometimes longer. Fathers don’t play a prolonged role in parenting.
“This is unprecedented, absolutely fantastic data,” said Mauricio Cantor, an Oregon State University marine biologist who was not involved in the study. “This study is the result of so much research effort.”
Why people, dolphins or other creatures use baby talk isn’t certain, but scientists believe it may help offspring learn to pronounce novel sounds. Research dating back to the 1980s suggests that human infants may pay more attention to speech with a greater pitch range. Female rhesus monkeys may alter their calls to attract and hold offspring’s attention. And Zebra finches elevate their pitch and slow down their songs to address chicks, perhaps making it easier to learn birdsong.
For the dolphin study, the researchers focused solely on the signature call, so they don’t know if dolphins also use baby talk for other exchanges — or whether it helps their offspring learn to “talk” as it seems to do with humans.
“It would make sense if there are similar adaptations in bottlenose dolphins — a long lived, highly acoustic species,” where calves must learn to vocalize many sounds to communicate, said Frants Jensen, a behavioral ecologist at Denmark’s Aarhus University and a study co-author.
Another possible reason for using specific pitches is to catch the kids’ attention.
“It’s really important for a calf to know ‘Oh, Mom is talking to me now’ __ versus just announcing her presence to someone else,” added Janet Mann, a marine biologist at Georgetown University, who was not involved in the study.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday blasted organizers of a weekend revolt, the gravest threat yet to his power, as “traitors” who played into the hands of Ukraine’s government and its allies.
Speaking in a stern tone and looking tired in a five-minute TV address near midnight, Putin sought to project stability. He tried to strike a balance between criticizing the uprising’s perpetrators to prevent another crisis, and not antagonizing the bulk of the mercenaries and their hardline supporters, some of whom are incensed at the Kremlin’s handling of the situation.
Putin, whose troops are stretched thin in the face of a Ukrainian counteroffensive, praised the rank and file mercenaries for not letting the situation descend into “major bloodshed.” And he said the nation had stood united, although there had been localized signs of support for the uprising.
Earlier in the day, the head of the mercenary Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who led the rebellion, defended his short-lived insurrection. He again taunted Russia’s military, but said he hadn’t been seeking to stage a coup against Putin. On Friday, Prigozhin had called for an armed rebellion to oust the military leadership.
Putin’s address was announced by his spokesman in advance and billed by Russian state media as something that would “define the fate of Russia.” In fact, the address didn’t yield groundbreaking developments.
Abbas Gallyamov, a former Kremlin speechwriter turned political analyst, called the address weak. In a Facebook post, he said it was a sign that Putin is “acutely dissatisfied with how he looked in this whole story and is trying to correct the situation.”
The Kremlin later showed Putin meeting with top security, law enforcement and military officials, including Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, whom the uprising had tried to remove. Putin thanked members of his team for their work over the weekend, implying support for the embattled Shoigu. Earlier, the authorities released a video of Shoigu reviewing troops in Ukraine.
Putin, who declined to name Prigozhin, said mutiny organizers had tried to force the group’s soldiers “to shoot their own.”
He said “Russia’s enemies” had hoped the mutiny would divide and weaken Russia, “but they miscalculated.”
Western officials have been muted in their public comments on the mutiny, and President Joe Biden said Monday that the U.S. and NATO were not involved. Speaking at the White House, Biden said he was cautious about speaking publicly because he wanted to give “Putin no excuse to blame this on the West and blame this on NATO.”
“We made clear that we were not involved, we had nothing to do with it,” he said.
Prigozhin said he had been acting to prevent the destruction of Wagner, his private military company. “We started our march because of an injustice,” he said in an 11-minute statement Monday, giving no details about where he was or what his plans were.
The injustice apparently was a government order requiring Wagner soldiers, if they want to remain fighting, to sign contracts with the Defense Ministry by July 1, which might effectively disband the group despite its battlefield successes in Ukraine. Prigozhin also accused Russia’s military of attacking his troops, prompting his march.
The feud between the Wagner Group leader and military brass has festered throughout the war, erupting into mutiny when mercenaries left Ukraine to seize a military headquarters in the southern Russia city of Rostov. They rolled seemingly unopposed for hundreds of miles toward Moscow before turning around after less than 24 hours on Saturday.
The Kremlin said it had made a deal for Prigozhin to move to Belarus and receive amnesty, along with his soldiers. There was no confirmation of his whereabouts Monday.
Prigozhin boasted that his march was a “master class” on how Russia’s military should have carried out the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. He also mocked the military for security breaches that allowed Wagner to march 780 kilometers (500 miles) toward Moscow without facing resistance.
It remained unclear what would ultimately happen to Prigozhin and his forces under the deal purportedly brokered by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.
Prigozhin said Lukashenko proposed finding a way to let Wagner “continue its work in a lawful jurisdiction.” That suggested Prigozhin might keep his military force, although it wasn’t clear which jurisdiction he was referring to.
Though the mutiny was brief, it was not bloodless. Russian media reported that several military helicopters and a communications plane were shot down by Wagner forces, killing at least 15. Prigozhin expressed regret for attacking the aircraft but said they were bombing his convoys.
Russian media reported that a criminal case against Prigozhin hasn’t been closed, despite earlier Kremlin statements, and some Russian lawmakers called for his head. In his address Monday, Putin didn’t repeat threats he had made Saturday to punish the mutiny’s leaders.
Andrei Gurulev, a retired general and current lawmaker who has clashed with the mercenary leader, said Prigozhin and his right-hand man, Dmitry Utkin, deserve “a bullet in the head.”
And Nikita Yurefev, a city council member in St. Petersburg, said he filed a request with Russia’s Prosecutor General’s Office and the Federal Security Service, or FSB, asking who would be punished for the rebellion.
Russian media reported that Wagner offices in several Russian cities had reopened on Monday and the company had resumed enlisting recruits.
In a return to at least superficial normality, Moscow’s mayor announced an end to the “counterterrorism regime” imposed on the capital Saturday, when troops and armored vehicles set up checkpoints on the outskirts and authorities tore up roads leading into the city.
For months, Prigozhin had blasted Shoigu and General Staff chief Gen. Valery Gerasimov with expletive-ridden insults, accusing them of failing to provide his troops with enough ammunition during the fight for the Ukrainian town of Bakhmut, the war’s longest and bloodiest battle.
Prigozhin said most of his fighters refused to come under the Defense Ministry’s command. He said Wagner had planned to hand over the military equipment it was using in Ukraine on June 30 after pulling out of Ukraine and gathering in Rostov, but they were attacked.
Russian political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya said on Twitter that Prigozhin’s mutiny “wasn’t a bid for power or an attempt to overtake the Kremlin,” but a desperate move amid his escalating rift with the military leadership.
While Prigozhin could get out of the crisis alive, he doesn’t have a political future in Russia under Putin, Stanovaya said.
It was unclear what the fissures opened by the 24-hour rebellion would mean for the war in Ukraine, where Western officials say Russia’s troops suffer low morale. Wagner’s forces were key to Russia’s only land victory in months, in Bakhmut.
The U.K. Ministry of Defense said Monday that Ukraine had “gained impetus” in its push around Bakhmut, making progress north and south of the town. Ukrainian forces claimed to have retaken Rivnopil, a village in southeast Ukraine that has seen heavy fighting.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday after visiting troops in the war-torn Donetsk region that his military had advanced there as well as in Zaporizhzhia. “Today, our warriors have advanced in all directions, and this is a happy day,” he said in his nightly address, without providing details.
The events of the weekend show the war is “cracking Russia’s political system,” said EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.
“The monster that Putin created with Wagner, the monster is biting him now,” Borrell said. “The monster is acting against his creator.”

Over 2 million Muslims will take part in this week’s Hajj pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia, as one of the world’s largest religious gatherings returns to full capacity following years of coronavirus restrictions.
The Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, and all Muslims are required to undertake it at least once in their lives if they are physically and financially able to do so. For the pilgrims, it is a profound spiritual experience that wipes away sins, brings them closer to God and highlights Muslim unity.
For the Saudi royal family, which captured Mecca in the 1920s, organizing the pilgrimage is a major source of pride and legitimacy. Authorities have invested billions of dollars in modern infrastructure, but the Hajj has occasionally been marred by tragedy, as in 2015, when over 2,400 pilgrims died in a stampede.
Here’s a look at the pilgrimage, which begins on Monday, and its meaning.
WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF THE HAJJ PILGRIMAGE IN ISLAM?
The pilgrimage draws Muslims from around the world to Mecca, in Saudi Arabia, where they walk in the footsteps of the Prophet Muhammad and retrace the journey of Ibrahim and Ismail, or Abraham and Ishmael as they are known in the Christian and Jewish traditions.
As related in the Quran, Ibrahim is called upon to sacrifice his son Ismail as a test of faith, but God stays his hand at the last moment. Ibrahim and Ismail later are said to have built the Kaaba together. In the Christian and Jewish traditions, Abraham nearly sacrifices his other son, Isaac, on Mount Moriah, which is associated with a major holy site in Jerusalem.
The Kaaba was a center for polytheistic worship among pagan Arabs until the arrival of Islam in the 7th century, when the Prophet Muhammad consecrated the site and inaugurated the Hajj.
Muslims do not worship the Kaaba, a cube-shaped structure covered in a black, gold-embroidered cloth, but view it as their most sacred place and a powerful symbol of unity and monotheism. No matter where they are in the world, Muslims face toward the Kaaba during their daily prayers.
The Hajj has been held every year since the time of the prophet, even through wars, plagues and other turmoil.
In the Middle Ages, Muslim rulers organized massive caravans with armed escorts that would depart from Cairo, Damascus and other cities. It was an arduous journey through deserts where Bedouin tribes carried out raids and demanded tribute. A notorious Bedouin raid in 1757 wiped out an entire Hajj caravan, killing thousands of pilgrims.
In 2020, amid worldwide coronavirus lockdowns, Saudi Arabia limited the pilgrimage to a few thousand citizens and local residents. This is the first year it returns to full capacity.
HOW DO MUSLIMS PREPARE FOR THE HAJJ?
Some pilgrims spend their whole lives saving up for the journey or wait years before getting a permit, which Saudi authorities distribute to countries based on a quota system. Travel agents offer packages catering to all income levels, and charities assist needy pilgrims.
Pilgrims begin by entering a state of spiritual purity known as “ihram.” Women forgo make-up and perfume and cover their hair, while men change into seamless terrycloth robes. The garments cannot contain any stitching, a rule intended to promote unity among rich and poor.
Pilgrims are forbidden from cutting their hair, trimming their nails or engaging in sexual intercourse while in the state of ihram. They are not supposed to argue or fight, but the heat, crowds and difficulty of the journey inevitably test people’s patience.
Many Muslims visit Medina, where the Prophet Muhammad is buried and where he built the first mosque, before heading to Mecca.
WHAT HAPPENS DURING THE HAJJ?
The Hajj begins with Muslims circling the Kaaba in Mecca counter-clockwise seven times while reciting prayers. Then they walk between two hills in a reenactment of Hagar’s search for water for her son, Ismail, a story that occurs in different forms in Muslim, Christian and Jewish traditions.
All of this takes place inside Mecca’s Grand Mosque — the world’s largest — which encompasses the Kaaba and the two hills.
The next day, pilgrims head to Mount Arafat, some 20 kilometers (12 miles) east of Mecca, where the Prophet Muhammad delivered his final sermon. Here, they stand in prayer throughout the day asking God for forgiveness of their sins in what many view as the spiritual high point of the pilgrimage.
Around sunset, pilgrims walk or take buses to an area called Muzdalifa, 9 kilometers (5.5 miles) west of Arafat. They pick up pebbles to use the next day in a symbolic stoning of the devil in the valley of Mina, where Muslims believe Ibrahim was tempted to ignore God’s command to sacrifice his son. The pilgrims stay for several nights in Mina in one of the largest tent camps in the world.
The pilgrimage ends with a final circling of the Kaaba and further casting of stones at Mina. Men often shave their heads and women clip a lock of hair, signaling renewal. Many will assume the title of “hajj” or “hajja” — a great honor, particularly in more traditional communities. Some paint murals on their homes with images of airplanes, ships and the Kaaba to commemorate the journey.
The final days of Hajj coincide with Eid al-Adha, or the festival of sacrifice, a joyous occasion celebrated by Muslims around the world to commemorate Ibrahim’s test of faith. During the three-day Eid, Muslims slaughter livestock and distribute the meat to the poor.

For the first time in his more than 20-year rule, President Vladimir Putin’s power appeared to hang in the balance this weekend.
And even though the rebellious Russian mercenary forces who descended on Moscow have turned back, Putin will struggle to project the image of a man in total control that he once did. That could set the stage for further challenges to his rule at home and could weaken Russia’s hand in the war in Ukraine.
With spectacular ease and a stated aim of ousting Russia’s defense minister, Yevgeny Prigozhin’s Wagner troops swept into Rostov-on-Don, a city of 1.1 million people, and seized the military headquarters there. They then continued hundreds of kilometers (miles) north on a lightning march toward the capital without meeting any serious resistance.
Some were even cheered — a sign that Prigozhin’s positioning of himself as an enemy of a corrupt and incompetent elite resonated and a detail that will not be lost on those surrounding Putin in the coming days.
“This whole episode has sowed really profound anxiety across Russia’s elites,” said Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the Institute for Strategic Studies. The actions of the Russian leader’s one-time protégé “severely shake confidence in Putin among those around him who matter.”
For several tense hours, the Kremlin seemed powerless as Wagner convoys rolled through Russia, smashing occasional roadblocks and shooting down aircraft sent by the military in a desperate attempt to stop them.
With the bulk of Russian forces tied up in the fighting in Ukraine, authorities rushed a motley collection of troops and police to protect Moscow, dug up roads and even blew up bridges to slow down the onslaught.
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and General Staff chief Gen. Valery Gerasimov vanished from public view on that decisive day, amplifying the sense of weakness and lack of control.
In a televised address to the nation broadcast early Saturday, a somber-looking Putin accused Prigozhin of betrayal and compared the situation to the collapse of the Russian empire in 1917.
But hours later, the Russian leader granted Prigozhin amnesty — on condition that he goes into exile in Belarus.
While the Kremlin tried to cast the deal as a wise move that helped avoid a looming bloodbath, it was a remarkable compromise for a man who has relentlessly suppressed any sign of dissent and sometimes violently silenced foes daring to criticize him.
The quick pardon for Prigozhin stood in contrast to the Kremlin’s methodical crackdown on dissidents and critics of the war in Ukraine, who have faced prosecution, forced exile or even violent deaths. For many in Putin’s Russia, his handling of the revolt was a sign of unforgivable weakness.
“Prigozhin demonstrated that it’s possible to capture a city of a million people with impunity, put demands to the country’s leadership, refuse to obey its orders and mount military marches on Moscow while killing Russian soldiers on the way,” said Viktor Alksnis, a retired Soviet air force colonel and current hardliner who expresses views shared by many Russian hawks, who have been increasingly critical of Putin’s rule and his handling of the war in Ukraine. “Russia has moved a step closer to its final and irreparable collapse.”
The blow to Putin comes on top of repeated Russian failures in his 16-month war in Ukraine.
Gould-Davies noted that the mutiny has destabilized the military and badly hurt troop morale, opening new opportunities to Ukraine, now in the initial stages of its counteroffensive.
“This is Russians killing Russians on Russian territory while Russia is trying to contain a Ukrainian counteroffensive,” Gould-Davies observed. “This is not what Russia wants in wartime.”
While the deal with Prigozhin could bring some Wagner troops under the control of the Defense Ministry — a demand that the mercenary leader had previously rejected, precipitating the conflict — it’s a small compensation for the huge damage to the government authority that the crisis has inflicted.
Kirill Rogov, a political analyst who has long studied Putin’s politics, observed that the problem was of the Russian president’s own making: He tolerated Prigozhin’s feud with the top military leaders as part of his strategy to shift blame for the military blunders in Ukraine and play members of the elite against one another in an apparent belief that he could fully control Prigozhin.
“Golem’s creator always thinks that he can be stopped and he makes him look increasingly convincing in order to scare others,” Rogov wrote in a commentary, referring to a clay creature brought to life in Jewish folklore.
Putin did stop Prigozhin in the end — but at a steep price.
